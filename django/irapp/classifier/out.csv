This place is a area staple! Been around for years and not much has changed - I see this as a good thing! Stable and reliable!My family goes every year for St. Pattys Day corn beef! Very nice place for a bar night dinner, or to catch up with some friends over drinks!	good
Got my mojo back after having a few of their appetite teasers. Love LPW for a no-frills bite to eat.	good
Don't go here for the decor, but the staff is friendly and the fried pickles are very tasty.  Good value.	good
I believe in awarding stars bearing in mind the type of restaurant reviewed. One can tell by the name that LPW won't replace Ohio's lost Maisonette restaurant in Cincy any time soon, nor does it aspire to do so, but for a sports-bar type venue, these folks do it all right, and do so at the right price!Stopped for lunch on a Saturday.The lady got a cheeseburger and fries, I got scrod and broccoli, we split an order of their fried pickles as an app.The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection.They got the spears vs. chips decision right!The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare, but happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share!  And here's the kicker they were under four bucks! Kudos Mr. Pickle; you done good!The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly, with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior, ... the fry guy here knows his craft!And the burger was good as well.. ...typical of the genre.  I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger.The scrod was a very generous sized portion, nicely caramelized and served with lemon and butter and perfectly done.When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered, it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share.My dinner came with a salad, which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce, but rather freshly cut romaine, a cuke slice or two, carrot shreds and tomato, and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and butter.The service was quite good, although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended, but that's a management issue, not the server's fault.Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book, and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal, the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented!I'm all for efficiency, especially when it affects how quickly I can get out of a restaurant.That move garnered the fifth star!We both stated that we will go back in a heartbeat!	good
If you like fried food and laid back, then this is the place for you.  Nothing that will blow your mind, but the people are great, the restaurant is laid back and casual and the food, while not very creative, is cooked well, presented well and the prices are not ridiculous.	good
THE CLASSIC BURGER IS AMAZING.  It's definitely a top ten burger. The fries are good too.	good
I was not impressed with how gross this place is - I wasn't sure I wanted to order anything. The food was not outstanding. I think I would go across the street to the Tavern!!	bad
Okay bar food. Nice bar setting but food is average, service is average and in general doesn't really art itself apart in anything. Would I go there again? Probably if I'm in the area. Would I go out of my way to go there or make note of it to others? Probably not vegetable soup was good though and wings were fairly priced.	neutral
Was boozin and cruisin with my canine comrade. Went all the way out to Hudson via Brecksville/82. Looking for anything to Yelp. Nothing. Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day. There was a deli, but it opened at fucking 11! Who even wants to go to a deli after 11? Weak. Breezed through Peninsula. Winking Lizard? Bah. Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.Cozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men. I won't wait four more years to come back.	good
Alright, i was about to give it 3 stars bc it's not that great, but it's super cheap... wait, but it's kinda filthy too, so umm, 3, final answer.  The food is edible, but a bum could afford to eat here, so i mean, it sure beats eating out of a dumpster.  Cheap brews, cheaper food.  I think the building is made out of iron, my phone practically turns off whenever I go inside.	neutral
Okay, so it is a bar with an old fashioned family restaurant attached. We were there almost 2 hours for the Tuesday night burger special. They need more staff. The table was a little sticky. However, the food was delicious. The French fries were nice and crispy, and the Half pound burger didn't taste like a pre-made frozen patty. Our total bill was $15.30 for 2 meals and 2 Cokes. We'll definitely go back.	good
3 stars is fair for this pub. The food is good and well priced for a bar. Tuesday has $5 burgers and chicken sandwiches. The pecan pie is good for dessert. I got the chicken dinner, it came with a 6 oz chicken, broccoli, steamed potatoes, salad, and roll. It was ok. I'd stick with the burgers though. The salad was fresh. Their fries are really good.	neutral
Unmmmm, no. It's a bar with tables in the next room. It's feels grungy. Service was good, food, not so much. Praying I don't get sick!Everything tasted like it came from a can! Nothing fresh or tasty about it. Guess who won't be back?	bad
"Have dined in twice now and today was take out for corned beef sandwich. I don't know why I keep thinking this place is going to change. Food is at best ""ok"". The inside is a dive needs some serious updating. This would be ok if this place was a hidden dive bar with amazing food- not the case.Today's lunch- puke. Dry corned beef, probably the worst I ever have had. Lession learned never returning."	bad
This place is very dark and dingy on the inside. It is the cliche of townie bar. The food was just okay but the drinks were super cheap and the service was good.	neutral
This small tavern, has great burgers and the best fries within 100 miles!  It's simple, unpretentious, and the folks are mellow and ready to accommodate their customers.  I understand they added music on the weekend and will surely check it out on the weekend.	good
The food is typical.  Wait how much was my meal... Then that food is awesome!  Very friendly atmosphere.  Prompt service.  Diner/Bar type place with no particular theme.  (Sorry if there is an attempted theme.  I didn't see it.)  Not a foodie spot or hidden gem, but something about this place just feels... nice.Side note: My apologies for my complete unintentional dine and dash.  Wrong card.  Also sorry to the other guest whose bill I signed for them.	neutral
There'a a reason that everyone loves this place; it's your typical neighborhood bar in the evening (it's typically middle-aged locals, not a rowdy crowd) but it's also a great place to grab a nice meal with your family during the day. They also have a fish fry every Friday during Lent. The food is really good for bar food, and it's very reasonably priced. Obviously, this is not five star fine dining, but if you're looking for a cheap and inviting place to hang out with friends and family, this is a great place, and the food is great for what it is.	good
Not particularly good. Bathroom is nasty. Food decent. Terrible cell phone signal and no WiFi. Probably won't return.	bad
Went here last Friday for dinner very disappointed!  Waited for ever for someone to tell us to seat ourselves and then waited forever for the waitress to come over it seemed they were very busy gossiping at the counter.  Food was so-so nothing special the salads good use cheese served very plain.  Better restaurants nearby.	bad
I can't give this palce 5 stars because hell, its just not a 5 star place.  But it's the Pickle!  If ever in Brecksville stop over at the neighborhood bar for cheap, quality food (you get what you pay for though), a typical old bar atmosphere, free popcorn, and sit in chairs that I swear haven't changed since I was 5.  The place is awesome, I'm there every weekend.	good
Great prices.   Good food. Typical fare: burgers chicken, fish, etc  Really friendly and eccentric staff. This place is a keeper.   Try the hot pickle. I buy them and use them in bloody marys.	good
Neighborhood bar, with the friendliness that comes with it.  Also the quality of food you would expect. Family friendly.	bad
We came here for dinner to celebrate my friends Birthday.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service is incredible but for some reason I felt like something was missing.  The food was decent but way over priced.  I guess for the money we paid I was expecting something else.  Overall it was a nice evening and my friend had fun so thats all that matters right?	neutral
Ah, Khotan... I knew you when (SIGH) you were something different.... a perfect blend of Asia's decor and food... and how far you have fallen since that time. While I still appreciate your service and your stunning looks, I am surprised by what has happened to your menu... sorry looking sashimi (though the uni was a standout... shouts out to Santa Barbara!!), uninspired hot foods (kung pao shrimp at $21? For real?? ).... even the drinks are sorry in comparison to what once was.... SIGH.  Perhaps this is why you are closing your doors from November 30th through January 3rd (Seriously? During one of the busiest times of the year in Vegas!?) At least you still have your Treasure Island pirate show, which will always be a sight to behold. Perhaps you should visit what you once were (read: Social House at Crystals) and reclaim your glorious days. Until then, I will continue to hold onto hope that you will find your spotlight (or at least a better menu) once again.	neutral
"Khotan sucks as a place to eat. The girls and I went to this place for ""Dinner"" but really all we got was appetizers. We went during happy hour so it was suppose to be cheaper, but it don't mean the size is bigger. I ordered some spicy tuna and it was $7 for like a tiny portion that didn't do anything for me at all. The roll were so tiny it was about the size of a quarter and I got four of those. BOO times 2. The only reason this place got two stars out of me was the bartender. They both were entertaining and he gave us some drinks for free. Atmosphere is really not impressive either."	bad
My boyfriend and I decided to go resturant hunting on our visit in LV for our 1 year anniversary..we didnt have a spot in mind but on our many, many, many walks on the strip we found Khotan. So I decided to call and make a reservation since I didnt know whether it was a forsure spot we would get in for dinner. *WHICH I DO RECOMMEND, BTW!* We got there and were greeted and waited in the longue/bar area..it was def cute, we were soon taken to our seats in the patio area (which i also do recommend esp if you come around the 9 o' clock time frame for the pirates show.) OMG, when were going up there are beautiful gold deposit boxes all around then you hit the patio/seating area and you get a great view of the strip AND the pirate show..feels  like the fireworks are going to hit you haha.The food was great, me and my bf def recommend the chicken lollipops for a appetizer (get two bc i could finish that whole plate if i didnt have to share with my bf HAHAHA). You def wont regret it, I ordered the Khotan Beef plate and it was actually good! I wish it did have a little more but I was full forsure. My boyfriend had the Orange chicken plate I believe and he enjoyed that plate as well although he did wish he had more food on there...just b/c hes def a fattie. hahaOverall, great place for some pan Asian food, GREAT SERVICE btw!, great views, free show of the pirate show w/o the bussling of the crowds, patio seating is great and def a great overall resturant in vegas.	good
***for lounge only****Maybe I like this place only because my friend and I stumbled upon this place during happy hour.  Oh the two best words ever.  We ordered from the cocktail happy hour and I got some cranberry concoction (don't remember the name) and my friend had the asian pear.  I liked mine since it's tart as I like it but my friend didn't care for it. She did love her asian pear though since it was pretty sweet.  We were going to have dinner so we didn't splurge on appetizers but the couple next to us took advantage of the happy hour prices.  I took a peek and it looked like it was good since they ate every bite of their sushi rolls.  Bartender was really nice as well.  Noted, maybe on a weekend this place is poppin' but I enjoyed the quietness in the busy Vegas atmosphere on a Thursday night.	good
I love the decor and vibe of Khotan. A little hard to find at first but once you enter, it's worth the search. I really liked the safe deposit boxes in the entryway - made for some cute pictures. Food: Yum! I think it *may* be hit or miss based on reading other reviews but we chose wisely. Here's what I liked:Spicy tuna roll - just enough spice, quality fishCurry noodles - love the curry they used, definitely singaporean. big shrimps. Ginger chicken with broccoli - a lighter option with clean flavors.Service: Great! Our sever recommended his favorite drinks and was helpful answering questions about the food.This would be a great date spot. I'll be back to enjoy the atmosphere :)	good
"Worst sushi rolls ever -- the shape and size of a box of Tic Tacs with chewy rice and a rectangular layer of raw fish on the top. Bland, difficult to eat. We were hoping it was the same chef as Social House (restaurant at what is now Khotan's spot) because there was a jalapeno yellowtail sashimi on the menu (like the amazing one we'd had at Social House two years ago). The jalapeno yellowtail sashimi was actually excellent. The rest of the meal was totally downhill. When we started walking upstairs to get our table, the maitre 'd called out, ""Watch your step because if you fall, I'd have to laugh at you.""So, they can't make sushi and they have some clueless staffers too. Don't waste your time or if you insist on going, try the hot foods versus the sushi rolls."	bad
My girlfriend and I stayed at TI and we were looking for an easy dinner one night, so we decided to stroll into Khotan.  Meh...I wouldn't say the food was bad, but it wasn't good.  I think the best word to describe it would be: amateurish.  It would be hard to believe that they had real sushi chefs in the kitchen, or that they used high quality fish.  Some of the fish didn't taste like anything!  No taste!The service was pretty good, but our waiter didn't seem to know much about fish.Don't waste your money on the Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer.  I don't know how anyone could have the nerve to charge $22 for 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi (if it even was Hamachi) on a chip.  The Tuna Tartare wasn't that great either...  I've had better hors d'oeuvres at weddings.The concept of the Salmon Parmesan roll sounded good, but when eating it, the Parmesan didn't make sense.  I was in the mood for noodles, so we also ordered the Crab Lo Mein.  It was basically ramen noodles with a few pieces of tasteless crab on top.  I could've made ramen noodles and topped it with imitation crab for about $2 and it would have been just as good, or better, than their $14 dish.	bad
"I was extremely excited to visit this restuarant since I""d been planning my reservation there for weeks, thanks to a smart groupon buy.  I have to say our seating was amazing out on the scenic deck.  However, I do have to say, that the food was blah.  I ordered the Salt and Pepper Prawns and the waiter expressed to me that they had a few shells underneath HOWEVER the Prawns came whole, fried with shells and eyes.  I mentioned that I was expecting a few shells but couldn't eat through these,,,he said well, I told you that it came with shells and half-heartely offered to recook them.  This only after the plate had been sitting for twenty minutes.  He avoided our table like the plague as I could tell he could clearly see I was NOT eating.  AT the end he offered a free dessert but by that time it was a little too late for me.  I don't like to compare high end asian restaurant to PF CHANGs but on this night PF would win.  Try The GRand Wok in the MGM grand."	bad
"Only 4 stars because of the expense--without our $55 Groupon, our meal for two, including one large house sake, would have been over $100.However, even if we hadn't had the Groupon, it would have been WELL worth the money. What a find!! The decor is gorgeous, we were waited on by two attentive garcons (sat at the sushi bar so chatted with the sushi chefs as well), and the menu is extremely creative and--most importantly--DELICIOUS. Our waiter recommended the yellowtail appetizer with tempura jalepenos in a light, yummy sauce and WOW was he right. We both ""mm'd"" through our whole meal, starting right from the tasty beginning. Every piece of sushi (we got the large maki for dinner so we received about 20 pieces of sushi) was fresh, generous and absolutely fantastic. By the time we finished our large dinner order we were almost full, but definitely not ready to stop eating! We each ordered another round of nigiri--my boyfriend got tuna and I got salmon, YUM!What a hidden gem...thanks to Groupon for helping us find this one! We will DEFINITELY be returning next time we're in Vegas."	good
"Sushi was very average and very expensive with no wow factor. Tasted just ""bleh"". Miso soup was very salty and ginger salad was made from a lot of weird lettuce that was not cut small and difficult to eat. Took a long time to get the salad. We asked to sit on the balcony to watch the show and they gave us a table at the backside so we couldn't see. Service was barely ok and kept making excuses why it was taking so long."	bad
A Superficial place in Treasure Island, trying too hard to be upscale, however, the food quality does not meet its price tag, which is way overly priced.  Fast food quality, price higher than TAO, go figure. Staff also try too hard and gets annoying. No wonder their business is not good at all. TI is not an upscale place to visit either...	bad
I can't say from my experience that I understand the mediocre reviews for Khotan. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We didn't have the sushi and stuck to mainstream pekinese type dishes; lettuce wraps, edamame (ok, they're Japaneze), lobster curry and sweet&sour chicken, all of which were fresh and tasty. I suspect this place may suffer from an expectations standpoint. It is not that expensive, we paid approaching twice the price at Jasmine two nights before for a similar quality meal. I am going to brutally honest here and suggest what is expensive to a TI guest is not the same to a Bellagio one ( we are neither by the way). Give this place a try. We really liked it.	good
Like several other reviewers, I went to Khotan because a friend had a Groupon and we of course waited until the last minute to use it.I checked out the menu before going and was really scared.  It really looked like a Panda Express menu with such exotic choices as sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  Authentic, Khotan is not. But, hey, it's food and we had a coupon.The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes. 	neutral
We stumbled upon khotan by pure laziness...We were watching the TI show (wow...not kid friendly anymore) and gambled a little before we started getting some hunger pangs.  So we wandered a little bit and saw the downstairs opening for this place.  We thought it was a small casual place and had no idea it was considered upscale dining.The host greeted us then talked into his ear radio....He then escorted us to the elevator and sent us up.  We were then greeted by another host and seated in the bar area since it was a quiet sunday night.  We just needed a few bites to eat so we could make our flight without starving.Started off w. some edamame (the norm, nothing crazy) then we shared chicken lollipops (not bad), kobe sliders (looked dry but were actually moist), gai lan side dish (cant go wrong w/ veggies) and a noodle dish (don't remember which but it was dry dry dry and super chewy/tough rice noodles...terrible).It was just a spot we ended up at due to convenience of it's location...right in front of us as we were about to give up looking...Food was good but not memorable. (well except the super awful noodle dish)	bad
The restaurant was pretty slick, great atmosphere and a really cool patio. If you happen to go for dinner the pirate show is pretty cool since you are watching it from the back side of the boats. The Edamame was really buttery and apps were spot on. The drinks were great, and my ginger mojito was really refreshing after a long day on my feet. The reason this wasn't a 4 star was because my diner was rather salty and not much better than something I would get at my local Chinese take out place. The food was so so, but the drinks, app and atmosphere were great.  Worth a visit and they frequently have Groupons and happy hour specials.	neutral
We used a Groupon to try out this restaurant in TI.  We sat at a table on the patio to watch the 8pm Sirens show.  Pros:- nice patio with misters and adequate seating.  Good location to see the show (even if the show is GOD AWFUL- but I won't rate this place according to the show.  My eyes were bleeding after watching it.)- decent variety of food selections and full bar- decor and ambience were pretty niceCons:- food was overpriced for the quality.  I had the Teriyaki chicken, which was dry.  California Roll appetizer was dry and fell apart.  The lettuce wraps were decent appetizers, as was the tempura platter.  We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed.  - service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way.  She disappeared for a bit while we ate and my husband had to go to the kitchen to get more soy sauce.  We eventually had to call out the Mgr to ask for service, and things got better after that.  He was very apologetic and checked in to make sure things were OK.  I think if we hadn't had the Groupon, we would have not come here.  Without the Groupon, we would have spent the $200 elsewhere and received much better quality food and service.  I suppose it might be worth it to come and try the lounge area during happy hour.	bad
"I ate at Khotan tonight with my husband, sister-in-law and her husband. We were there to use our Groupons before they expired.The service was really good. So was the lighting. We ordered the sliders, Tom Yum with chicken and the crispy asparagus to start. The sliders were pretty darn tasty with a side of pickled ginger that our server recommended. The Tom Yum was really good too. The asparagus came out ice cold. They brought us another one, but it still wasn't great hot. The coating is way too thick. We all agreed that they use Rice Krispies for the ""fry.""For dinner, we ordered the Pad Thai (awesome), Khotan beef (decent), and crispy walnut shrimp. All of us like walnut shrimp from Ping Pang Pong and China Mama. We were expecting it to be hot. It was cold. Apparently, that's the way they serve this dish - fried cold shrimp. Once we knew, it wasn't that bad on the bed of vinegary salad. Just wasn't what we were expecting.Our dessert of mini-cupcakes was comped. The worst cupcakes I've ever had. Three cupcakes - mango, coconut and chocolate, each with their own sauce. I really, really wanted to like them. They didn't taste fresh and were too cold. The cake wasn't fluffy and was really dense. The restaurant is beautiful. Worth a try. Don't expect miracles."	neutral
This place is weird.  So we were greeted by the hostess in front who looked like she was wearing butt pads.  No skinny Cambodian-looking girl would have an ass that sticks out ten inches from her back unless she stuck a basketball in there, seriously.  Then she told us to go upstairs because that's where the real restaurant is at and we were again greeted by another Asian hostess. While walking upstairs, you would feel like you're in a bank's safe box room because seriously, that's what it looks like, no joke.  Fun to play with, but weird.  Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.  As long as its good, I like it.  I liked how our waiter came back to refill my friend's drink a couple times without being asked.  I like attentiveness.  I like staffs who pretends to be genuine as good as they're faking it.  Having missed our menus for the first ten minutes, the service is above average. Even if money grew on my orange tree, I wouldn't come here again though.	bad
I'll echo what others have said.  The service was poor.  This is a $6 million upfit and it's gorgeous.  The food is good, but not spectacular like the atmosphere.Lots of potential here in the front and back of house.	neutral
What a waste of time and money.  We had dinner thinking that the chef from Social House was still there but I guess I should have read the other reviews posted by yelpers.  I guess if I had to describe the restaurant it would by con-fusion...horrible creations that make you think twice about eating there (salmon parmesan roll, crab lo mein Alfredo, wtf?).  Terribly expensive and it seemed that the staff didn't care too much about what was going on around them.	bad
Not worth the money. Bad drinks and equally bad overpriced food. The pay roll was bland and possibly the worst I've ever had. It made the $35 roll taste even worse. The mongolian beef is better at P F Changs.Service was good. Decor was very nice. It takes alot  for me to say these things about any place. Good luck.	bad
Recently ate at Khotan. The food was quite good. I had the cashew chicken and my wife had sweet and sour chicken. While somewhat expensive, and the service a bit slow, it was a good experience overall especially with the Groupon discount saving us $25.	good
Much MUCH better as Social House.  What the hell was TI thinking?  SH was more Japanese influenced, I would say Khotan is more Chinese influenced, with a Japanese pricetag.  Grub:*Jalapeno Hamachi, not as buttery & fresh as I'm used to, soy overpowered, I liked the battered jalapeno slices, great texture, $22*Rainbow Roll, snow crab & fish were not fresh, $18*Broccoli Beef, liked the Broccoli Rabe aspect, the beef was eh, $24*Gai Lan, cooked nicely, & not too greasy, $6*Crab Lo Mein Alfredo, really strange, like the powdered packet in Hamburger Helper, but oddly comforting, $14This place is pretty pathetic, but they serve a mean cocktail & boast a great alfresco dining option.	bad
Was craving sushi after walking around the outdoor mall at Treasure Island. Just happened to come across this place. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't necessarily good either. Decor is nice, service is average, the bartender was cool though. For the price they charge I would pass on this place. I know it's Vegas but there's some standards you would expect based on the price and the food just didn't meet the standards in my opinion.	bad
"Khotan is Closed and ""Senor Froggy"" resturant."	bad
I came here back when it was social house, and now Khotan. I tell you it's like night and day. And I don't mean that in a good way. While the decor hasn't really changed much. The menu sure has and not for the better. My experience here while being social house was so wonderful. I figured regardless of the name changing I'd give it a shot. Boy was I wrong. Like I mentioned before the decor is still unique. Dim, sheik, very Asian like of course. But wait, they use to have a dj in the lounge area. Gone, go figure. And the waitresses from what I remember were a lot nicer. Anyway. I ordered a few sushi pieces, with some chicken like kabobs. I believe a salad. Had a few beers. Sushi was very Mediocre. Chicken was dry. Salad was salad. Can't really remember anything memorable from my meal. Aside from the overpriced food. A big disappointment. I doubt I'll be coming here again. Only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because it was once social house. Anyway if over priced wanna be asian food is your gig. Along with half ass service. Be my guest.	bad
Mediocre food. 50$ for one person. I could have had better food at Panda Express. The orange peel chicken was cold and lacking flavor. The veggies in the dish tasted like they weren't washed before being cooked. Only good thing about this place is the atmosphere, it is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star.	bad
"You can IGNORE all the complaints regarding price as this restaurant (formerly Social House, and formerly Khotan Pan-Asian Cuisine) now goes by the name of Khotan Asian Bistro and has a NEW menu with lower prices.More importantly, there a few restaurants in Las Vegas that offer a more impressive atmosphere.  Anyone comparing it to ""Panda Express"" or even ""PF Changs"" is simply not doing this place justice.  The modern and sleek decor hasn't changed too much from the days it was Social House except for the fact they have added some stunning jade and ivory sculptures on display.Most importantly, the food presentation, taste and service are well beyond expectations for a ""reasonably"" priced restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip.Can you get Asian food as good or better at a lower price down the street (Spring Mountain) in Las Vegas Chinatown?  Yes, of course, but no where near the same dining experience in terms of location, seating (indoor/outdoor), ambiance, and cool vibe.I would challenge some of those that previously rated this place less than 4 to give it another try.  Unless you are a complete foodie-snob and/or have no clue what a ""normal"" price is for a Las Vegas Strip restaurant, it will be difficult to rate this dining experience lower than a 4.  Of course, that's IMHO."	good
We went there to celebrate our anniversary. When we called to book a reservation, they asked if it was for a special occasion. When we got there, no one congratulated us. No one seemed to care that we were even there. There were lots of staff walking around, but most of them seemed to be chatting amongst themselves. The food was ok, but not worth the $67 bill for 2 dishes and one drink. The jade exhibit was amazing and the atmosphere was good. It could have been better. We were interested in dessert, but got the impression that there was none, until we were asked after we finished dinner. I would have made room if I knew there was dessert.	bad
Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. It has a cool atmosphere, but it's super expensive and the food is so-so for the price you pay. It's also super dark, so it's hard to read the menus. This is probably to hide that you're paying $45 for a few pieces of steak. If you're here at the right time, Treasure Island's pirate show will play right outside your window, so you can listen to the cannons and fireworks go off while you're eating a romantic dinner. That could be a good or bad thing depending on your personality.	neutral
While looking for a restaurant on the strip that had excellent decor and a romantic atmosphere, but at the same time a reasonable price, i found Khotan.The service was good, our waiter was very social and always kept our drinks filled. I tried out the orange peel beef and my girlfriend tried out the Khotan beef both were very delicious dishes, but me being a fat ass was still hungry after since there isn't very much in the plate.what i suggest: 1. Eat out in the patio if you are going to be there at nightfall, Khotan is right above the pirate show at T.I.2. Chicken lollipops! really good appetizer	good
"My four stars are for the lounge area and the food.  The service in the dining area was lame.The lounge was great.  During happy hour (5-7PM) there are drink and app specials. And since ISLA was packed to the gills, my fella and I decided to check out Khotan.  The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game. We were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner.The dining area is upstairs.  Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers. Pretty impressive.  Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio.  The inside of the restaurant was dark.  Not mood-making-romantic dark.  More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark. Oh well.We ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup.  The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken.  My one gripe about the soup...there were pieces of fried scallion (or something...I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat.  I ended up picking it out of my soup.The pad thai was to die for. Super tasty and a really great portion.  I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) - but hey, it's Vegas baby.  My fella loved the singapore style noodles.  He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy.We enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito. (Give me anything with Canton in it and I'm set. Yum.) So - let's talk about the service. The servers were polite and great when we saw them.  We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes. This could have definitely had to do with the fact that for a while we were the only ones inside the dining area, but the servers never acknowledged the crap service.  A simple, ""Sorry 'bout the wait"" would have sufficed.  Oh well.Good thing the food is so good. I'm dreamin about that pad thai. Mmmmm..."	good
This place was really good when it was Social House, now its just an expensive place to get sub-par food.  The place reeks like Ed Hardy perfume (below the restaraunt).  The service was ok, but the food was over priced and not up to Vegas quality standards.  I would definietly try somewhere else and not waste my money here again.	bad
The best description I can give about this restaurant is that it is the Panda Express of asian food and not worth the price.For appetizer we had the crispy asparagus. It was just japanese crackers deepfried around asparagus. Too weird of a texture but okay to eat. Only 6 sticks. So to me, 6 asparagus heads is not worth that price.I got the lobster curry. Again, for the price, it was not worth. i can get thai green curry for $5.95 down the street and throw in some steamed lobster and get the same effect. hubby got korubuta pork chop. okay, but have had much better elsewhere.the place is also really dark, to the point where you cannot read your menu. you have to put the menu an inch away from the candle on your table. lame.and the TI sirens show in the background is VERY annoying.skip this place. and TI, please don't make lame asian restaurants. it's an insult to the main demographic of your casino.	bad
Best place for fries! Breakfast sandwiches! Hot Meals! I didn't realize everything is made in house from scratch!!!!!! From the hummus, salads, pasta and pasta sauce!!!! The Chicken Shawarma  sandwich is like nothing you have had before! It's juicy, fresh and huge!!! Also! Ladies it doesn't fall apart!!!! Great lunch place!!!! I personally am a fan of the falafel sandwich! They stick French fries in it for me!!! Also, the people that work there are very sweet, humble and down right good! This place is more like family! They know everyone by name!  You walk in and instantly greeted with great service. They give you time to decide and help you customize if needed. On several occasions I have gone into the restaurant in a rush between meetings and they are fast!!!! Which I appreciate. I have brought in a few clients with me and they never disappointed with the food. Always consistent. If you are in the area.. Give them a try!!!! They ROCK!!!!!!	good
I used to come to this joint when i worked nearby. It is family owned and the food is absolutly exquisite. They get alot of regulars and have a very loyal clientele. Friendly staff.	good
First time going here. Great food. I had a whole wheat chicken shawarma. Was really good and refreshing and filling. Will be going back in the future.	good
This restaurant is all about good home cooking. Wonderful spices, excellent quality and care taken. Lots of repeat customers are seen at Sami's!!I love their coleslaw and very fresh ingredients are used!!	good
Bring a sweater and leggings/pants with you, because this place is freezing! There's something wrong with their ventilation/air-conditioning system. It might be warmer if you sit next to the grill.The sushi is always good but I've never had the grill. It's a great place to get together with friends, family or colleagues for any group event. Children's birthday parties are celebrated a lot here. I plan on celebrating mine here in September.	good
It's always a fun time with the food cooked in front of you. Nice quality and decently healthy... Price point is a bit high, but it's fun from time to time.	good
It is not just a meal ... It is fun evening with a delicious food and a great presentation .I gave it 4 star because it is not at the same level of Benihana in Toronto and the US.I believe it is the best available Japanese grill house in Montreal island .It is a bit expensive because of the location.	good
Toyo, Toyo, Toyo... where do I begin. I was first introduced to this place 4 years ago, for my friend's 18th birthday. We had an unbelievably fun time with the tempenyaki grills and a wonderful chef/performer. I came back another time for a company dinner (my suggestion, woo!) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables. We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied.I've come back several times since, in much smaller groups. Unfortunately, the chefs never perform or make a spectacle for smaller parties only the large groups, pretty disappointing. Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times.It's also not really that cheap given the portions. Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward! I'm sure there are better tempenyaki places in Montreal, but Toyo will make do.	neutral
Great staff, great location and great food.The chefs are amazing and make the experience memorable. Great Japanese food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date or even a party.	good
the cook was really entertaining ! food was delicious and well seasoned and cooked. great for small groups !	good
Had a great experience here. Our chef had lots of fun with the meal and put on a good show. Food was fantastic and a large portion. Great time all around.	good
bit pricey but great for groups. Not sure if it's good for dates. Food: teriyaki chicken was great! Shimps and beef were ok. It's just salt-pepper and soy sauce in cooked food. No special spices/exotic ingredients. Portions are ok, too. 3 starts just because it's entertainment else i'd have given this 1 star based on just food.	neutral
Cuisinier qui met la bonne ambiance et une viande de qualité au rendez-vous ! Le restaurant est très calme et conviendra pour un bon restaurant entre amis !Les prix semblent raisonnables vu la quantité dégustée.	good
Such a cool environment .. its awesome for partys snd the chefs always entertaining the guests I find it a very new york feeling... I love it. The food is great and so are the drinks , we went once for sushi .. it was great!! So fresh and clean.	good
It's a really nice restaurant , very similar to benihannas if anyone is interested ...I ended up getting the jumbo shrimp & it was made to perfection anyone that loves Chinese food would understand	good
I was going out to dinner with a client and wanted something good near my hotel. My brother, being a local, recommended Toyo. Although you can get sushi here, the main attraction is the Teppanyaki.As other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat you with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show/dinner. Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.Our chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).Half way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).We really had a great evening here. I highly recommend Toyo if you're in the mood for a fantastic dinner and a show.	good
"I  have been going to this place regularly for over ten years. It is consistently awesome. I agree with another reviewer, if you're in a rush, it's not the place for you. And it is awkward to sit with a bunch of people you don't know. However, more often than not, my fiancé and I are seated at a table alone which is nice. Considering the portions, this place isn't that expensive. It is one of the only restaurants where my fiancé doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later. Our bill (with tax but no tip) usually comes out to $115. This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon).  In terms of the ""show"" aspect, I'm not a huge fan of this. I have only experienced chefs who really put on a show when dining with large groups. But this, for me, is a positive. This place is our go-to when we want a filling, casual and awesome meal. I highly recommend it."	good
Showed up to a place less then 20% full. Guess it was Monday night. Waited 40mins before chef came to cook for us and only after I went to the manager to complaint. Chef quickly came, cooked out meal within 15mins and we were done in the same amount of time. Definitely not repeating due to mediocre food with little to no selection. The staffed blamed the 40min wait on a 20% filled restaurant on the chef being slow! Good way to throw your chefs under the bus.	bad
This Bar Restaurant is a wide open airy space within the Apex |International Hotel.We booked a table for Fathers Day Lunch. I have to say the food was excellent, the service was very good & value for money on the Sunay Lunch menu was excellent. The soup was piping hot, the Roast beef melted in the mouth! Didn't have room for puds but they looked fantastic	good
Attached to the hotel my parents were staying in, Metro was restaurant of choice for a quick - but classy - meal before they were to return home a few hours later.Metro is, I admit - a beautiful restaurant, modern, clean and bright. But my compliments will end there.The meals were expensive, somewhat tasteless, tiny and my soup starter left an odd coating in my mouth for the rest of the meal. The staff were rude and unhelpful, bearly conceling thier bordom and hate for thier jobs. Service was so slow that I counted my dad checking his watch more than once with fear for missing the plane in two hours time. Not the best.Now, I am willing to admit, we may have just been there at the wrong time or something, but still, it was an awful experience which I will not want to repeat.	bad
Had dinner here in december last year, it was close to my friends apt and we just went there because we didn't want to go far.Food was nice, a bit pricey though, I had Orzo pasta, sun blushed tomato, rocket, parmesan & pine nuts, the pesto on it could've had less oil on it as I found quite greasy even for a pesto based sauce. It came with a nice salad so this was a good surprise. We had a nice rose wine and service was alright.	neutral
It's fine. There are typical food court choices. The seating area is nice, and they clean it up very regularly. It's a food court. If you have to eat here, I'm sure you'll be able to find something in your budget and to your taste.	neutral
"Seeing as there are reviews for Dine on L3 (Yorkdale mall) and Urban Eatery (Eaton Centre), I figure I would review the new food court in Square One which is going by the name of ""Food Central"".  It has the same concept as Yorkdale and Eaton Centre, as they give you real cutlery and dishes as opposed to the plastic ones.  Compared to Eaton Centre, and Yorkdale, this is a lot smaller, but there is still at least 20 places to choose from including some of the newer entries into the food court wars (Big Smoke Burger, Amaya Express, SU&SHI, Shanghai 360, Chipolte, Szechuan Express) plus the older ones (A&W, KFC, Manchu Work etc.).Overall, it's not a bad place to eat if you are on your lunch, can't decide what to eat or are just hanging out at the mall, but not worth a special drive (it is a food court after all right?)Also, compared to Yorkdale, there's no special sit down restaurants close to the food court besides Earl's."	neutral
"Although I appreciate Square One trying to improve shoppers' dining experience, what I dislike about the whole concept behind Food Central is that it sorta promotes an apathetic, lazy attitude amongst diners.Good:  Use of actual stainless steal cutlery, melamine trays, bowls, cute condiment containers, cups, etc.  Newly renovated eateries, washrooms, seating. Bad:  Not enough seating, especially at peak times, considering the amount of eateries, and there aren't any visible garbage/recycling bins, so as a diner, you can either leave your tray/trash on the tables OR bring your tray to the station to have someone else clean up after you.  :(This is not a good message to insinuate to shoppers.  Instead, I think Food Central should promote a more community-like attitude such as ""please clean up after yourself"" and set up different bins - similar to IKEA/Whole Foods - so that everyone can do their part!  There are already enough lazy slobs out there, we don't need to raise a new generation of them.As of now, Food Central is not 100% complete, still uneven flooring around outskirts."	bad
Much more nicer than before. Very modem look now.Need more cultural variety though i think.I like the new dishes system.	good
Much nicer than the old food court that I remember, that's for sure!I worked at Square One for several years back when I was in university and remember the food court quite well...it was my savior on the (many) occasions that I would forget to bring my lunch to work. How I didn't pack on twenty pounds at the time is beyond me. It was adequate back then, if pretty standard. Now with a lot of malls stepping up their game, it's nice to see that Square One has followed suit.Everything has been redone and renovated and it has a nice and modern look, although it does look a little cold and sterile compared with how it used to. Lots of new places as well as the old, so there really is a good selection. It's still overpriced and often dull mall food but at least you have options. They've also made the switch to reusable cutlery and dishware, which is obviously great. All-in-all it's still a food court in a mall, but at least it's a pretty decent one with a lot of choices. Though I don't work in the mall anymore, nor do I frequent it as much as I used to it's nice to know that if I did, I wouldn't get too sick of having to go through a very limited rotation.	neutral
This is a typical mall food court, mediocre food over priced, bad attitude = Square one food central	neutral
The service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive--an ideal balance. The friend I met for dinner here had been here many times before and usually ordered the meat dinner for two. We decided to try the vegetarian version this time. Delicious! The dhal was fabulous, as was the saag paneer. Fresh naan and thick, not too sweet lassi. The kheer was similar--rich, but not overly sweet.In all, a delicious meal! We lucked out in being seated without a reservation, but the waiter seemed a little nonplussed at first, and we had an option of one of two tables, as all of the rest of them were reserved. So--probably best to call ahead if you're planning on coming for dinner.My one regret is that the dinner special was so enticing--and delicious, and filling--that I never got a chance to try the other tempting options on the menu!	good
What everyone else said!  I'd like to put a good word in for their mango lassi, too.	good
This place is great - nice food, not very expensive, usually easy to get a table, a nice mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.  Highly recommend.The service can be a little inattentive, though - but if you get their attention then they are very friendly and helpful, you just need to know that if you want something you need to wave someone over.	good
"so disappointed !i had fairly high hopes for this place based on the yelp reviews id perused so i was very let down when it turned out that i had been mislead ...first of all the good : the decor , if trying a little too hard to create a ""fine-dining"" type of atmosphere , is pleasant and i really liked the artwork on the walls featuring the nepalese (or indian ?) countryside .  the music was also nice traditional indian music .  the servers were very pleasant ; they kept their distance and didnt offer much banter but were kind , polite and attentive .the bad :  THE FOOD !  after waiting quite a while in an empty restaurant to receive our order , we thought that maybe this was a good sign as some of our meal was being prepared ""fresh"" .  sadly this was not the case except maybe for the bindi masala which was slimy and undercooked .  the aloo gobi featured very hard cauliflower and stale tasting , dried out potatoes .  most disappointing was the butter chicken which was VERY tough and dry .  the sauce was not rich at all - definitely couldnt detect any butter and very little cream .  the tomatoes didnt lend any sweetness as they should but instead made the dish quite bitter .the naan was okay .if we hadnt had a discount through groupon , it would have felt like a complete rip-off .  the potions were VERY tiny and all four members of our party left very dissatisfied .no offence to the other reviewers but im wondering if maybe the higher rating is partly due to the large student population in the area ; maybe this place is earning high praise from people who have little experience with indian food or what torontos competitive dining scene really has to offer ?"	bad
Pretty good nepalese food. The portions are a bit small so go for an appetizer to go along with your entree. Went for a la cart dinner but they also have a lunch only buffet that looks like it's worth checking out.There's an extensive tandoori portion of the menu which looks very interesting. I will have to try that next time.	neutral
Good quick service and all of the chicken dishes were fantastic. Highly recommended for anyone in the area. I'm looking forward to going back.	good
This place converted me to malai kofta, but the butter chicken is the piece de resistance.Come for lunch for a $10 buffet and enjoy an endless supply of their amazing rice pudding and naan, but be warned that the lunch butter chicken has lots of bones while the dinner a la carte butter chicken is made with boneless chicken breast.	good
Dinner; Jan 15, 2011 Enjoyed a great meal with friends. The place was crowded and we waited 10 minutes (around 8 pm) My partner enjoyed the Chicken vindaloo.... way too spicy for me, but tasty... the butter chicken was one of the best I have had and the lamb saag was perfectly balanced. Don't bother with the appetizers, just order extra naan or other type of bread. Prices are decent the service impeccable.	good
delicious well-priced food with an awesome location on bloor streetshared several with five people, had saag lamb- amazing, very tender and perfectly cooked lamb chicken jalfrezi- excellent level of spice vegetable tandoori- great dish for sharing, comes steaming hot with a huge variety of vegetables and paneer, my fav things to order here shrimp jalfrezi- just as good at the chicken jalfrezibhuteko cali- traditional vegetable dish from nepal, very well seasoned, reminded me of my travels in the Kathmandu Valley!yes service is slow but I have been to Nepal and service is WAY slower (they make everything from scratch and multiple orders means long waits) in that country so it's a very traditional laid back dining atmosphere	good
This place is wonderful. The flavours are rich and vibrant, with all the spices and herbs tingling every taste bud. Everything is reasonably priced so there's no fear of feasting on wanky food for two hours only to have to go to Pizza Pizza afterwards.	good
Everest is probably my favorite restaurant in Toronto.  The service is great, the decor is contemporary and the food is superb.I highly recommend the Aloo Tama Bodi, Chicken Momos, the Lamb Vindaloo, Panir Tikka and the Chicken Tikka Masala.Some of the best dining service I've had and the food is unique and of high quality.	good
Amazing foodGreat serviceReasonably priced buffet! Sometimes they have a sitar guy playing. WOOO!	good
Amazing Indian Food. ordered the vegetarian meal for two and was very impressed with everything-- the vegetables were delicious, the saag paneer is the best I have ever tasted and the Naan is so fresh and tasty. Great service 	good
This is 100% based on the lunch buffet experience:-the food is foul. old leftovers- overpicked and not delicious.-the bread is stale-the selection is slightly pathetic compared to the queen street row of indian AYCE lunch buffets.  i'd give this place another try to redeem themselves and becasue i trust that yelpers aren't completely wrong but i fidn it hard to believe that experience was not typical.	bad
So, this review is based on my experience with the lunch buffet.  On food alone, I would have rated 2 stars because it all seemed a little old at that point (like it had been out for a while), but I came in at the end of lunch.The rest of the experience was great, though - it was a cheap meal, it was fast (I was alone, eating on my way to a meeting) and the service was unobtrusive but consistent.  My water was always full and I had as much naan as I wanted.A note: a lady at a nearby table was complaining that the food was all too spicy.  I am pretty spice-averse, and found everything to have heat but didn't mind it.  So, if you're like that lady and have a zero spice tolerance, beware.  Maybe don't eat indian food though, you know?	neutral
Went here for dinner on a weekday and the live music was great, makes the experience much more enjoyable.  The service was good and not too over-the-top.We loved the curry chicken, the garlic naan was good too, but I prefer regular naan.  Their spicy shrimp was very flavourful.  The quality of the dishes was very high.The portions are much smaller than what I am used to at other Indian places though and it's a bit pricey too.  Overall, it was great though, I'd come back.	good
The food was delicious. I had a vegetarian homemade cottage cheese 	good
The food was good and have and I have no complaints. I was hoping for food that differentiated itself a bit more from Indian and that's why I'm only giving it 3 stars.Overall it was good but not memorable.	neutral
I've been to Mt Everest countless times over the years for their cheap buffet lunch (believe it costs $10.99 now but back in the day it was only $8.99)Tried out dinner here last week for the first time. I find the menu slightly overpriced. Most of the curries were $15 and that did not include rice or naan. Given this is the ANNEX and the decor/ambiance of this place is quite underwhelming, I think they are overcharging by a few dollars. Other similar type places with much better food (Banjara) have a more reasonable price point.My date and I ordered the Dinner for Two special ($36.99) which was definitely the most bang for your buck. You get a platter of tandoori chicken, boti kabob and chicken tikka (two pieces of each), a lamb curry, mutter paneer, peas pulav and 1 order of rice and 1 naan. Some kind of rice pudding for dessert too.Food was pretty tasty, didn't blow my mind but was definitely good.Service was bothersome for me - very spotty at this place. At times they were over topping off water every 5 minutes, and at other times we could not flag them down to get extra rice or the bill, etc.Lunch buffet is still a great option!	neutral
The food here is very good, and the service is exceptional.  There is a wide variety of foods, from vegetarian to meat dishes and non-spicy to spicy ones.  The Naan, though seemingly pricey, is very good and big.The food comes relatively quicky, and despite the relatively small portions, they are actually very rich and filling.	good
"Ok, everyone else who has commented here needs to calm down a little bit.  Yes, this restaurant is nice, but come on...5 stars?I split a non-vegetarian combo for 2 with my girlfriend and it was delicious.  In particular, the chicken from the tandoor was uncharacteristically juicy.  Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars.The ambiance is where it looses a bit of cache for me.  There was a sort of awkward white guy playing a sitar in front of what must be the lunch-time buffet station.  There was just something about that scenario that screamed ""We're throwing the South Asian kitchen sink at you, what more could you want?  We have a sitar, Indian food, an inexpensive lunchtime buffet and waiters wearing bowties.""Don't get me wrong, I'd come back here in a second, especially to order more stuff from the tandoor or the delicious mataar paneer, but it is NOT a 5 star restaurant."	neutral
What a very nice place at Bloor Street west . You can have a nice buffet with a great selection of Indian food or you can order from the menu. I recommend the garlic naan and the mango lassi.	good
The restaurant sits on the south side of Bloor Street with glass windows looking out onto the street. Like most Toronto restaurants it is long and narrow. There is a bar when you enter that separates a section of tables at the front and some near the kitchen. The decor is dark and rich with lots of wood accents. When we arrived it was almost empty but while we were sitting it was full in no time. The staff was attentive and polite providing service when needed. The menu featured a selection of expected East-Indian and Nepalese dishes. We opted for some onion bhajis, a roti, a garlic naan, and two vindaloos. Although the bhajis were a little greasy and too salt everything else was delicious. It was what one would expect for a place frequented by locals from the neighbourhood.	good
My favorite Indian/Nepalese place in Toronto. I love the vegetarian combo, and the Chana Masala, and the Aloo Gobi...and so much more about this place. The servers are all extremely kind and friendly. If you order a complicated dish, it may take more time to come out of the kitchen--but at least you know they are cooking it with care and not throwing it in the microwave.	good
Great neighborhood Indian joint.  Can't beat the takeout student special - 2 (smaller size) dishes, rice, naan/roti, salad, raita, and a beverage for $10.99 (veg) or $11.99 (non-veg or combo).	good
It's a pleasant atmosphere to dine in. I liked the paintings of Nepal on the walls as well as the post cards near the door. They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them. The food is not bad per se, but it's pretty generic and forgettable. The Nepali portion of the menu is limited, and unfortunately the differences between the Indian and Nepali dishes were very minimal, for eg,: our server told us that the only difference between Bhuteko Cauli (Nepali Entree) and Aloo Ghobi (Indian Entree) was that the latter had potatoes in it! I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.We ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.The service was good except that they mixed up our order, but that was corrected in a jiffy.Dinner for two came to about $ 52 with tip and tax. Pretty expensive for a very middling experience.  I'd have liked them to put more effort in their food than their decor.	neutral
i ordered for pick up and got the daal and mountain potatoes. both dishes were excellent, really quite tasty. i'm impressed. what i'm not impressed with is the prices -- it's just hard for me to fathom such prices for a small amount of desi food.i hear the lunch buffet is much better bang for your buck, so i'll try that.	good
While the service was very good and the decor was passable, the food at Mt. Everest left a lot to be desired.While the lunch buffet only cost $9.99, the food was very, very average. There were two meat dished, a few vegetarian dishes, and a small salad bar, so there was some variety, but the quality left a lot to be desired. The meat dishes were dry and cooked carelessly - the pieces of chicken looked like they'd been hacked at - and the veggies at the salad bar were dry and looked rather waxy. The only good dishes were the vegetarian ones, and while they tasted okay, it didn't feel like much care had been taken in their preparation.Dinner, while much better, also came with a much steeper price tag. An order of tikka masala, rice, and naan set me back $16, and the portions of tikka masala and rice were truly very small for the price tag.	bad
I ended up at this place accidentally. I met my friend nearby, and I had told them of a place I wanted to try out on Bloor. (they thought I was referring to a place that they walk by that is always dead, but I wasn't) and so they quickly were like... here's an Indian place... let's go here.The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. There is tastier Indian food out there, and in larger portions too. From reading the reviews, I should have went for the lunch buffet. As I paid 20 dollars and left hungry... but again, I came to this place accidentally.	bad
Went for the $8.99 lunch buffet, and thought everything was quite tasty and high-quality. Flavorful with mild hotness.My only complaint was the number of small bones in the goat curry -- had to carefully chew to avoid hitting the many pieces of bone.	good
It's been a few years since I last tasted the food from here. We didn't feel like going out the other day so we ordered for delivery. I couldn't be any more pleased!The came right away and everything was delicious! I'll be going back soon! :)Their Naan bread is to die for!	good
I can't remember the name of my dish but it was a Northern Indian specialty with ginger and a blend of unique spices. It was one of the best meals I ever had.  The place is nice and quiet and the servers were friendly and efficient.  I hope my  fiancée's friends from Toronto get married so we can eat at this restaurant again	good
Whether you want to get the $10 lunch buffet (such a good deal) or a night with a fine dining atmosphere without the fine dining price tag, this is for you.Their food is excellent, really - especially during dinner time. Service is impeccable (they seriously make you feel like you're at a restaurant that would charge double the price) and prices are very reasonable.The food at the lunch buffet is most likely just extra leftovers from the previous night so the tandoori chicken won't be as juicy and the naan not as fluffy/warm, but the curry is just as good. Either way, you can't get a better deal for $10.Try the Lamb Vindaloo (very spicy) or the Chicken Korma!	good
My wife and son and i chose Mt everest based on our location on bloor west and yelp reviews.  The decor is clean and pleasant and we were greeted as soon as we came in.  After our orders were taken, it took quite a while for our food to arrive and we were starting to get jittery.  It was early for dinner, 4 45 , but it was not clear why it took over 35 minutes.  All i can say is that the wait was worthwhile, the food was very good.  Tandoori veggies, lamb tikka, hunters platter, chicken masala, everything was hot and tasty, spiced just right.  The sauce and yoghurt marinade were balanced and just right.  What we appreciated the most was the quality of the lamb and other meats.  They do not cut corners on quality. A satisfying dinner.	good
Really, really good.  They do Indian and Nepali, which is a great combo since I haven't had too much exposure to Nepali food yet, and I've discovered that I love it.  Momo Dumplings FTW.The lunch buffet isn't the cheapest ever, but it's all-you-can-eat, so skip breakfast!  They are a lot more careful with food preparation for dinner (i.e. meat is boneless, selection is better) but you know what?  I get the lunch buffet anyway, since it's just so tasty.We never manage to spend under $50, which is a shame since I'd like to incorporate this restaurant into daily life.  However, for a treat, this place is definitely classier than its price range specifies.  Friendly, undervalued/underrated, tasty, and tasteful.  Highly recommended.	good
I'll admit, I've never actually sat down at Mt Everest. One time a friend popped over with some leftovers that were so good I didn't know what to do with myself, but after ordering takeout, I am not impressed.Okra is my favourite vegetable when it comes to Indian cuisine and I order it whenever I can. Mt Everest's bhindi masala over some uninspired rice left me satisfied (it's actually way better as reheated leftovers) and I enjoyed the nice spicy kick to it, but the garlic naan was flat out disappointing. I'm a bit of a garlic naan connoisseur and I am not quite sure what to even say about what I tried because there was not much to it. It wasn't garlicky in the slightest, not even buttery, and the naan's texture was dry, tasteless, and chewy in an unflattering way.I am for sure willing to give Mt Everest a second shot because I walk past it all the time and would really like to try some of their other items, but first I need to recover from this meal that cost over $30 (two entrees, rice, and naan - really?) and a bit of an upset stomach.	neutral
Been here a few times for dinner, and every time I've been happy with the service and quality of the food. This place gets busy, so make sure to call in and get a reso if you think you'll need one. When I feel like Indian, this is the place I go to!	good
Me and my friend wanted to dine on some Indian food over a movie. I had previously gone to Mt. Everest for the lunch buffet and found it decent enough to order delivery. I ordered butter chicken, naan and drinks. The delivery was done in 30 minutes which is very good when compared to delivery times of other Indian restaurants. The food:1. Butter Chicken: Delivery quantity was very small when compared to the actual dine-in quantity. The chicken tasted as if it was just put into the butter chicken gravy and served. We wouldn't have cared much if only the gravy tasted good. Being an Indian, I can easily differentiate good butter chicken from the rest. Unfortunately, this wasn't the best I have had in Toronto. 3 out 5 stars.2. Naan: The Naan was a horror story. It wasn't cooked well. I could taste the raw flour which made them inedible for us. Apart from that, the naan smelled very bad. 0 out 5 stars.We had to throw out the naan and ate the butter chicken with bread. Totally ruined the evening for us.	bad
I am a self-confessed foodie, and so I'll explain why this much looked-forward-to event turned into the worst nightmare. This restaurant has the most horrible customer service that you can imagine. Me and a friend went over in the early part of the evening and resto was already pretty crowded. One of the servers sat us down at a 'waiting' table in the front and said the table would be ready in about 20 minutes. He put down a couple of poppadums and then vanished. 35 minutes went by, the waiting area was getting pretty crowded. We were getting antsy by now. My friend went and found the guy and asked him for an update 'only 5 minutes sir!' OK..another 15 went by..my friend went again to look for the sever who (guess what) took one look at him and ran inside!! Meanwhile, even those waiting after of us were seated. We managed to find the floor manager who looked surprised that we'd been waiting for 1 hour plus. I had enough and said- look, either we sit asap or we can leave, to which he replied - not possible today...human error... I'd be happy to serve you another day...we waited for him to add the words 'on the house' or at least a measly 'at a discount' but NO! nothing...he just looked at us blankly. We left the resto hungry, tired and with a resolve to tell other foodies like us about how LITTLE THEY CARE FOR THE CUSTOMER!! Oh and btw- you get seated first if you're white! :-( epic, epic fail.	bad
Went here with a Nepalese friend of mine. Delicious Naan bread and whatever else we had was good too. My friend ordered in Nepalese so I have no idea what the dishes were, but they were sufficiently spicy and easily mopped up with the bread, which was hot and freshly made. I think one of the appetizers was called Momo, it reminded me of dim sum but much spicier. Here is a picture from a google search. http://www.travelandtournepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Momo-With-Sauce.jpgHighly recommend the momo. I would go here again on my next visit to Toronto. Price was reasonable.	neutral
this is a nice spacious restaurant with low lighting and simple but nice decor, nothing all that memorable, but clean nonetheless.we ordered the Non-Vegetarian Bhojan for two and to start we ordered the chicken momos.  so we had a mixture of indian and nepalese food.   the momos were absolutely deeeelicious.  they dough was cooked well (maybe slightly overdone, but if so just barely) so that it was soft and not overly chewy.  the filling inside was tender pieces of chicken and spinach i think.  that was very tangy, like it had soup inside or something.then the waiter brought us one part of a our Bhojan.  that had a couple different kinds of chicken, like the tandoori, some boti kebab - which might have been beef or lamb, not sure.  the chicken was surprisingly tender and tasty in both forms.  the lamb/beef both in its form here and in the lamb curry to follow were overdone and too chewy, too rubbery.  what was to follow was the lamb curry, the mutter paneer, a raita and a couple of rice puddings for desert.the sauces were pretty great, the accompanying veggies (though not substantial) were tasty, as they had absorbed the juices and accompanying sauces and spices of the meats.the rice puddings were fine, tasty, but i dont think itd be my first pick of deserts in general.all that was accompanied by 2 kingfisher beers a piece.  id like to come back here again, but id focus specifically on the nepalese dishes.	neutral
The food is undoubtedly very, very good and perhaps the best Indian food I've had in Toronto so far. No complaints there. But it is overpriced. The restaurant itself is quite large. I must comment that I disliked the service. One of the waiters was particularly rude, which comes as no surprise since Indians lack any semblance of tact (being Indian, I'm allowed to say that). Ordered the Fish Pakora, and Shrimp Masala with Naan. It took about 30-40 minutes for my entree to arrive, and what's worse, is they got my order wrong. After they did so however, one of the servers questioned whether I had indeed ordered that. On the other hand, they did rectify the order immediately, and apologized for the mixup Everything I ordered was delicious. I recommend getting the Shrimp Masala. I would return here.	good
Wow, um wow wow wow! I have lived near this restaurant for 6 years and never bothered to go in..why, I have no idea..it's a mystery.  Tonight, my husband and I ventured in, wanting to try something new out and let me just say, words cannot express how utterly delicious tasting the food is here!!  We selected the dinner for two and had plenty to eat, in fact, we overate, ensuring that there were no left overs.  We ended our meal with AMAZING mango juice...I'm so stuffed, I almost feel ill but it was well worth it.  The restaurant is moving elsewhere in the neighbourhood.  Wherever it ends up, I shall follow!!	good
"I have tried a ton of Indian food but never had the pleasure to Nepalese so I was instantly excited to try out this place.  The decor was nice and understated. Waiters were super attendant and polite!  So off to a good start.What we ordered:MomosJhane ko dalAloo tama bodiLamb BriyaniRaitaWhen asked how hot - we selected medium. Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour. We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat). They were right. The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day.The food itself was cooked to perfection. The lamb was cooked enough to be ""cooked"" but still melt in your mouth soft.   Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce. The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good).Even with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive! Which is rare for a unique dining experience downtown.I give it 4 stars only because I have no base of reference to know if this is the best of the best of Nepalese food - but it was definately fantastic and I will be back again (and again and again)."	good
The buffet is great, hard to go wrong with that.From the menu, my favourite item is the tandoori lamb skewers.   Very flavourful, a lovely hint of onions and spices.Staff have been reasonably friendly.	good
This place was good, but not great. I order the chicken vindaloo, because I wanted something pretty spicy! The waiter warned us the dish was very spicy, but we said that is great -- just what we are looking for. However, the dish wasn't very spicy at all, I was disappointed.......The palak paneer was strange, shreds of spanish instead of puree. The chicken hariyali on the other hand was excellent -- best dish out of the night!Would not return though, better indian places to go to.	neutral
Wow. The dinner is infinitely better than the lunch buffet. My friend and I split the meat bhojan for two. (Delicious and far better than Roti Cuisine - though rotis shouldn't really be compared with real restaurant style food). We added a bottle of wine and stuffed ourselves silly. The tandoori chicken hit all the right notes - I could taste the hint of lime from the marinade. Perfection.The bill wasn't bad. The meat bhojan was 38, the wine was probably another $30 - 40, and somehow our total was just over a hundred.	good
We went here for dinner after work. Ambience-Liked the music in the background. It was relaxing and wasn't loud and annoying like some other restaurants I've been to.Service-The service was attentive and friendly. It does take them some time to bring you the food so it's good to keep that in mind if you're really hungry.Food. We ordered the following:Naan breadButter ChickenChicken Tandoori-nice and hot as it was served on a sizzling hot place. Some parts got charred.Basmatic riceLamb Gosht recommended by the host-I found a lot of the pieces to be dried. Perhaps the leg of lamb would have been better.Verdict. I liked the butter chicken and chicken tandoori. I didn't try the naan but my dinner companions raved about it.I did find it expensive for the three of us as there was nothing to spectacular about this place. I would probably skip this place in the future and go to Little India for lunch buffet instead.	neutral
I've been to Mt Everest twice and I left quite happy both times. The service is excellent and the flavours memorable. I went with three other people and ordered the typical butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, garlic naan and a vegetarian dish with spinach, i forget the name. Normally, after eating Indian cuisine, I am usually ready for a nap. After eating here, I still felt quite alive...yet satisfied. There didn't appear to be a layer of oil on the top which I find with some other places. This, I know makes some of the flavour but at Mt Everest, it still tasted fantastic. Medium was the right amount of spice...a bit of a kick but not overwhelming. Also like most Indian places, it is always good to get a few different items and share. I will definitely be back soon.	good
Good food and the best-looking waiters in Toronto. Gotta go there at least once a year.The only Nepalese resto in town (used to be, haven't heard of any others opening) - so it's interesting to compare the flavours to some of the north Indian tastes in Little India.Stay away from the stinky traditional Nepalese thing in the veggie combo - even some of the waiters say they can't stand the taste/smell - kinda like you imagine sweaty sneakers would taste. Overall, a really nice addition to the Annex when it opened.  Still a reliable place for a pleasant meal in a clean resto.If you've never had Nepalese food, it is a bit of a must do.	good
"I had lived at Bloor and Spadina for many years and never tried the place, but finally got to last week... I absolutely love this place now. Like, seriously best Indian food ever!The server was AWESOME. My girlfriend had never eaten indian food in her life and she was quite scared of the ""spicy"". I had made it my mission that the first Indian restaurant she tried would have to be the best if I wanted to make a convert of her- and I was only going to get one chance at it... thankfully the server picked up on that and made some suggestions and was very kind explaining to her the signature dishes there. We got the Butter Chicken and the Chicken Tikki Masala (the server said the chef LOVES to make the Tiki Masala) and shared the rice and naan. While the Butter Chicken was good, the Tikki Masala really did take the cake as just incredible.Definitely going to go back there and try the buffet and very excited to know I'm in the delivery area.Highly recommend this place! Didn't get to see the Sitar player on this trip, but would certainly be a great bonus to go on the night's they're playing there!"	good
After realizing Nepalese food is kind of like Indian food, but healthier, I was all in. Headed down for a date dinner before a show at the Bloor Theatre. I called ahead, but was told no reservation necessary, but by the end of the night all the good tables were full. The Sitar player is quite good, but loud. Watch where they seat you, he may just be on break and then when the party gets started up again, boy are you in for a ear-ful.  I wanted to try the Nepalese specialties only. So, we ordered 2 naan and 2 dishes- the daal-like dish and the spinach dish. This was way more food than we could have eaten! But, considering we were headed to the theatre, didn't take any leftovers anyway.  But, price wise, the dinner for 2 is an amazing deal. If I ever go back, which is likely given our monthly Doc Soup at the Bloor, I'll go for that. As others  have said, the vegetarian dinner for 2 includes a beer per person, dessert, naan, rice, and 3 dishes! One highlight of the night was the Paneer Naan we picked out. It was like ghee-covered Inidan Pizza! Fresh out of the Tandoori oven, I could have finished off 3 of those alone!	neutral
With the temperature reaching a seasonal low -25 last week, we decided it wisest to order lunch to the office. I combed the online delivery options available and developed a taste for Indian food. I thought a little spice would warm me up - I was starting to feel like Michael Keaton in the unanimously critically acclaimed film, Jack Frost (imdb rating: 5.0).Based on the positive reviews here for Mt Everest, and being that I've never had Nepalese food before, I pushed to give it a try. We only ordered some garlic naan, plain rice, and two entrees:1. Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black beans in mountain spices)2. Malai Kofta (Cottage Cheese with vegetables in a cashew sauce)The dishes were both tasty! I really enjoyed the Aloo Tama Bodi's flavour, and the Malai Kofta was also delicious.Additionally, I was happy with the amount of Naan and rice we received in a single order. There was more than enough to cover both dishes. The ratio of bread or rice needed to cover a dish at Mt Everest is clearly 1:1.Which brings me to why my review is only 2 star. The portions! First of all, the Malai Kofta only came with about 3 small cubes of cheese. Both dishes came in small, unfilled containers (sadly Instagram deleted our photo evidence) and compared to Indian portions elsewhere (and the price) we were disappointed. Flavour-wise, I actually would recommend. However, it's likely that in-restaurant portions would be more significant and provide better value, so I wouldn't advise getting takeout.	bad
I always love the food here.  The lunch buffet is the best, but dinner here is great too, clearly a little pricier though.  Even so, I go back to this place all the time when I am in the neighborhood.  I went again last night with some friends.  Only one friend was disappointed, he ordered the tandoori fish, he said it wasn't very tandoori and the portion was small.  (But it looked the best, arriving on a sizzling plate)  He was lamenting all of this after the meal.  Everyone else was well satisfied though.  One had the lamb and as another friend of mine did years ago, they both loved it.  One tried the first chicken option on the menu and he loved it too.  I had the okra dish, it was so tasty.  The service was fast, polite and efficient.	good
We waited for-ever.  Accompanied by a Nepalese friend we were here to try the Nepalese section of a mostly Indian focused menu.  The Choyela chicken appetizer was fantastic; nice to try a different spice flavor than the usual Indian spices we're now accustomed to.  Khasi Ko Maasu goat was the Nepalese non-vegetarian entree I went with.  The menu de-emphasizes meat and lists it second; how dare they.	good
"With as imposing a name as Mount Everest, you might think that this Nepalese restaurant would be a place of epic food proportions. But instead of table-sagging selections of meat, rice, and heavy sauce, we left here after dining feeling full but not overwhelmed by the experience. It's a good place to come for creative and well-crafted North Indian food that will not leave a mark or make too heavy of an impression.  The dishes we ordered included a delicious portion of Aloo Tama Bodi (""Potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black-eyed beans cooked with mountain spices."") and a vegetarian tasting menu for two. The naan was excellent, as other reviewers have mentioned. The service was efficient, friendly, and elegant. The wine was an Argentinian Pinot Noir from Patagonia, pleasantly different from the norm. It fit well the food that was familiar but with a slight variation in presentation, spice, and flavor that made things interesting without being too intense.I kind of liked the balance here. Nothing was overdone. Everything was savory and satisfying. It made for a very pleasant meal. And that's something to celebrate."	good
I love this place, especially since it's about a thousand times better than the dreadful Everest Resto on Queen West. They are not affiliated in any way but people still confuse the two because of the name. ANYhow -this place actually offers REAL service and food that tastes amazing - what a concept!  The naan bread is perfectly fresh and everything we ordered was delicious. I can't believe this was the first place I've tried Baingan Bharta (Eggplant Curry) ...definitely going back for more next time.The waitstaff are all friendly and make you feel relaxed. They even seem happy to work here, which is pretty cool. Oh - and the bathrooms are sparkling clean. Not that it's the first thing on your list but I'm just saying...	good
Expérience géniale. Le Népalais c'est très bon. On peut choisir son niveau de piment, no / small / medium / hot / very hot. Service amical et attentif. Offre le doggy bag en partant.	good
Delish. Limiting my meat intake has brought me to fully appreciate a place that does meat justice. And justice Mt. Everest does.I've sampled a few items here and there on the menu, but I feel like it's hard to go wrong. Tikka masala tends to be a crowd pleaser, and I'd recommend the appetizer plate if you want to sample. Don't both with rice or dessert, though you may want naan to compensate for the spice. And again, although I try to be veg most times, I would say abandon any such intentions here and embrace the perfect succulence that is their meat dishes. Not a five though because it's a bit pricey yet fails to pull off the classy act (though it does try. E for effort?). Servers also tend to be a bit rude, which I can only ignore when prices are low enough to make me feel like I'm getting away with something.Nevertheless, I will likely be back again when I am craving meat that is cooked as it should be.	good
Id advise going on a weekday if you plan on going for dinner.On weekends, even with a reservation we waited 20 minutes for a table for 2. we then sat at that table for 10 minutes before even getting a glass of water.the food overall was quite good, from the apps to the mains, this would be a 4 star experience. but the service was brutal by being both unattentive and slow. honestly when the glasses on the table are empty, I expect someone to be taking my next drink order asap. So because the service is 2/5 and the food is 4/5 I'll give this a 3/5 overall.	neutral
Nice north Indian food, good service, pleasant ambience.  I haven't tried the Nepalese menu items yet.  Their lunch buffet is very good value if you like straight-ahead north Indian.	good
This is an incredible restaurant for a delicious date.  The vibrant and subtle sauces, spices and flavors take you on a journey beyond the senses.  Especially if you're a student who eats elsewhere normally, the dinner for two special at about $30 is remarkably filling and memorable.  High rating but it is not an expensive place for power suits or celebrities - although you can feel like one if you dress like it.	good
Went to this place with my wife last Friday based on all the positive reviews that I read on Yelp. I have to agree with most Yelpers, this is definitely a gem of a place.My wife had the Matar Paneer and I had one of the chicken dishes. Both of them were  very delicious and well prepared.I'm only giving this place a 4 because we had to wait a few extra minutes for the waiter to get our orders. Otherwise I would have given this place a solid 5.	good
I would like to make known that I was actually contacted by the owners because of my experience here. They are extremely professional, and I highly respect the way they choose to conduct their business. In the future, I will definitely choose to dine here again.	neutral
I was desperately in need of mexican food one day at lunch or else I was going to rip someone's face off... it was just one of those days and luckily I drove by this place.Definitely 5 stars for Maria, who I gather owns this place, as she was really nice and inviting. I needed to get my food to go, which wasn't a problem and I ordered a carne asade burrito which came with a side of beans and rice - oh I also got a bag of chips and salsa too! That was a plus, especially since I wasn't expecting it.When I finally got to sit down and eat my food it totally appeased the burrito beast inside me. There was a lot of food and the rice was delicious too. I think I spent around ten bucks...not too bad. Also, just a note - they only accept cards with a $15 minimum so if you plan to spend less than that, bring cash!	good
"This is a locally owned mexican restaurant that definitely has some good dishes and salsa.  However in these times I think that you need to excell on each level.  A restaurant can't rely soley on the food.Located on the northern side of Bell Road in a newer strip mall the outside looks very inviting.  As you walk in the decor is neatly situated and the atmosphere gets you excited for some possible good mexican food.  After your initial look around when walking in a little confusion may settle in. No one will greet you at the door and you wonder if you should wait to be sat or just seat yourself.  With more observation you'll notice a sign far away from the front door saying ""Please seat yourself.""  So you look for a clean cozy table and seat yourself, which is not a big deal at all.  Next you have to wait for someone to give you a menu to see what they actually serve.  You would think that menus would arrive very shortly, but I found out that on two occasions it took upwards to five minutes for them to arrive.  I am an understanding person , I can see the place is busy,and I love mexican food so I patiently wait with a smile.I could go and on about how long it took for my experiences here.  What I found out on two lunch visits that the owners are the servers as well.  No problem at all with this if you are good at what you do and are speedy.  However when each server has over a ten table section and can't get you in and out in a timely manner then it's time to hire some help.  Or maybe change your concept of the restaurant while having customers go to a window and order their food.I'll remind you that the food is really good, but everything takes forever.  My recommendation is to try takeout."	neutral
"Maria was super nice and inviting. 5 stars for service and ambiance. This place was clean. The rest room was clean. The chips and salsa were excellent, hot and chunky salsa. Food: I had the two soft taco meal with rice and beans. I mixed the tacos one with Chicken and one with Beef. The beef was carne asada on two small corn shells. Topped with pico. The chicken was chopped into cubes and was ""day old"" at best. It was not fresh. Topped with pico.The rice was good but I have had better, the beans were ok but really lacked flavor. The ""lunch"" was about 10 bucks and I felt cheated. Maybe I am not a Jalisco style fan?"	neutral
Yes, sometimes the service can be slow. If you are in a hurry, I'm sure that there is a taco shop somewhere close to you. If you are looking for THE BEST Mexican Food restaurant in Phoenix, El Conquistador is it. I cannot recommend this place enough to everyone I know. The old location used to be close to my house, but we still drive 15 miles out of our way to come here every week. The food is consistently outstanding. My favorite is the enchiladas verdes con pollo. Delicious!!!	good
"Had to stop by Big5 for a sleeping bag and saw El Conquistador on the way out of the parking lot. Figured I'd stop in and have a quick bite and be on my way. When I walked in the door the first room was completely empty and there was a woman standing and staring at me. I turned to look at the sign and turned back around. She still said nothing. I asked if they were open and she said what did the sign say? I said it says open (but why the hell are you just staring at me like you are not). She finally says there is a large party coming in and to sit in the other room. I said sure. Both rooms are fairly small. The decor is pretty whack. Old office looking carpet and old booths. I'm a fan of tile in restaurants. Spilled food and drinks just don't come out of carpet and especially old office looking carpet. The tables are covered with that cheap vinyl red sticky covers that also never look or feel clean. The benches were old and had tears in them. There were 3 gentlemen in another booth and other than that the place was empty. We were brought menus and drinks fairly quickly but no salsa. Another couple came in and sat down after us and were given chips and salsa immediately. Our waitress came back and asked if were ready to order. Still no chips and salsa. About 15 minutes into our ""quick"" lunch we were finally given a small bowl of chips and a couple of salsa. The salsa was ok. Nothing special. Same for the chips. We placed our orders and in comes out in about another 10-15 minutes. I had the El Conquistador burrito. Its a pretty large burro filled with a chile relleno, steak picado, and guac. It was ok. Really nothing good or bad. For 7.50 I expect greatness in a burrito. The wife had a bean and cheese burro w/ enchilada sauce. They were very tight on the sauce and cheese. It was the overall theme of the place. Very tight. For extra chips and salsa it was 1.50 according to the menu. The waitress came by another 15-20 minutes later and asked how we were. I said we were ready to go now. She didn't take our plates and she didn't bring our bill. Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and walk to the man at the front and ask him if could pay him directly. Our waitress, who's now talking on the phone, with our dirty plates still on our tables and check no where to be found even after I asked for it, makes a statement to the man that I am ready to go. No b, I was ready to go 20 minutes ago when I told you I was done. Now I'm ready for an apron cause I've been here long enough to get paid. From the conversations I heard the man and woman own the place. Good for them. I wont be back and don't recommend anyone else going back. I saw a newspaper article on the wall that AZcentral or New Times recommended it as a top 10 Mexican restaurant in town. Maybe it was good before they moved to this location. Maybe they lost some key staff members. Maybe they know something I don't. I doubt it."	bad
"I'm giving El Conquistador 4 stars for the food but 1.5 stars for the service. I wanted to LOVE this place, I really did -- I know that it is a mom and pop place, and it has a fantastic review already on Yelp and in the AZ Republic. I thought I would be a cooler Phoenician if I could make this my new ""my place."" Perhaps we hit on an off night (just a random Saturday), but our service was horrible. I was taking my neighbor out for dinner, and her comment was that ""we could have died back here and they wouldn't notice."" We waited at least 5 minutes before anyone came over to give us menus or take a drink order. We alerted them that it was our first time in the establishment and asked for recommendations, which were given but wtih minimal enthusiasm. We tried giving ""the eye"" or ""the nod"" and stopped short only of getting up to refill our own drinks during the meal. On the plus side, the food was very good and I have been craving it since my initial visit! I had a combination plate that let me taste a yummy chili relleno, taco and enchilada -- all were fantastic. My neighbor got the special (seafood enchiladas) and raved about hers as well. I will definitely visit again, but if the service isn't any better then maybe I'll turn it into my new special ""my takeout place."""	neutral
"Going to have to knock this place down a peg for the bad service.  What most reviewers are saying is true; great food but slow and inconsistent service.Maria is a doll but seems easily distracted. Her husband is surly and an incompetent bartender.  On two separate visits my wife and sister in-law ordered margaritas, in both instances the husband (not friendly enough to clue you in on his name) ""forgot"" to put the tequila in the drinks. In my four visits he seemed to hate being there."	neutral
The food is great.  The green chile is my favorite (spicy).  The el conquistador tacos are very good too.  I hear that the Chile Relleno is awesome also. I normally don't like mexican food rice however this is the best I've had.  The beans are just OK (nobody beat Rito's beans).The service is spotty depending on who it is.  Mark normally serves and is a little tight with the chips! (Even though u pay after the first bowl).  Maria, on the other hand, is a fantastic server and quick.The prices are a bit steep for a family style mexican food restaurant.  I've left there sometimes wondering how the bill was so high.  But the food makes up for it and my family goes there at least once a month!	good
"So....You say you want authentico?? My family secret shhhh! This place is owned by a lady named Maria. We have dubbed this place just ""Maria's"" we have been going here for year's!! When the white folk's around me say let's go to Valley Luna I have to school them on what's real food. This food is pure Jalisco and it is what it is! If you want some good home style cookin' in this part of town I would stop in for a bite! You better believe that this place gets busy for dinner so plan accordingly or don't go at peak times for those who don't like crowds. This is a nice little place w a bar and tv's. My sibling's would live here if they could my sister swears by the green chili burro, not for the weak as it brings the heat. I don't eat meat so I get the norm cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, etc all super in my book. I will take pics soon in the meantime here is a recent write up about the place http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/03/20/20080320elconquistador.htmlP.S. Closed Monday's"	good
The service was fine, and the atmosphere, while nothing special.The food was not that great, it was not as i was expected from the reviews here i read on yelp.sorry, i must had gone in at the wrong time. nothing more to say and very disappointed..will try again next month when i am in that area.	bad
Food was good, but $24 for lunch is a bit steep.  One burrito al a carte and a lunch special plus a beer and a soda..  Service was great.  I'll go back and try something else around dinner time..	neutral
What a lot of people don't understand about El Conquistador is that it is on par with the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. You do not go there for ultra-friendly and speedy service, you simply be happy that you are seated at a table about to eat some of the best mexican food in the world...maybe second to Los Dos Molinos, but hey that's all the way down by South Mountain. Mark and Maria are wonderful people churning out some incredible food. My all time favorite is the El Conquistador burrito enchilada style. It's filled with steak picado, chile relleno and beans and smothered in yummy green sauce.	good
Based on the review on azcentral.com we decided to check out El Conquistador.  We we entered the restaurant it was busy but booths were open.  Once we sat down we must have waited around 15 minutes until we received a menu and ask for our drink orders.  Once we ordered it took around 35 minutes for us to receive our appetizer.  And dinner followed shortly there after.  Not once during dinner did anyone ask us how our meal was or refill our drinks.  We had to eat our entire meal without a beverage.  We tried several times to get someone's attention but were unsuccessful.  We must have waited another 20 minutes to receive our bill.  Our meal was adequate (chicken fajitas, kids quesa and a gringo combo platter).The service was  poor and I would not go here if you are in a hurry.   Based on the reviews I expected more.  You would think after the reviews they would hire more help.  I would not go back or recommend this restaurant to friends or family.Maybe the owners should read others reviews about service.  It might help them out in the long run.	bad
sad to report lose to this area but CLOSED at this location now but expected to be open Wednesday at new location & 7th and Thunderbird	good
"I would give this place 2.5 stars but I will round up to 3.Very conflicted feelings.I have gone here a few times when they were located on 32nd and Greenway. Every experience was a little different.The good--Sometimes the service was good. Maybe it depends on their mood. When it was good it was usually the wife who was our server. She kind of reminded me of one my aunts. Warm, slightly teasing, calling us ""bambinos"". - I have always liked the food. I have had the chili relleno and enchiladas entrees. Both were a solid 7 out of 10. The beans are very tasty too.The bad-- When the service was bad it was usually the husband. Not friendly. Slow. Wouldn't refill our waters and soft drinks. Yet seemed attentive and talkative to other tables. Made us feel like total crap.- Slightly overpriced.- Charged for extra chips and salsa.- My husband didn't like the food.- Probably my worst experience was when I called at lunchtime to place a to go order. She said they couldn't take the order because they had a huge table of people. Just flat out refused. Guess what I wanted? Just a bean burrito! It takes 30 seconds to make.I didn't miss them when they moved across town."	neutral
"I was new to Toronto when I visited Local 4 a few months ago.  They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal.I invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers.So we get to Local 4...  and it's a huge let down.The food was mediocre to bad.  I had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact.Steak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad.Other friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right.But the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to ""try""), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You're touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  We were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I'm ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)In any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service.Judging by recent reviews, they're certainly not watching review sites for what people are saying, and that's too bad."	bad
I have a confession to make.In the year leading up to my departure from Toronto, I spent FAR too many hours at this place.  I couldn't get enough of it.  In fact, I turned many of my friends on to it, and they're thankful for it.  Excellent food (the burger and falafel are two standouts), excellent beer (Black Oak Pale Ale), and friendly service.  The owners are laid-back people, and it shows in the kind of place they run.  Stop by on a Monday and enjoy their pint special.  Tell Theo that Nick says hello from California.	good
Pallucci is a quaint Italian restaurant located in the Mount Pleasant/Davisville area.  If you weren't a local, you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.The menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however, that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.The house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region, and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me, but I like hybrids!The starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters, it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.We opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.For mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare, but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.My dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.To finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich, with a raspberry centre.Verdict:The staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm, and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.The food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh.  With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development.	neutral
Came for dinner, $70 coupon clutched in hand. One server--the owner--coping with a growing crowd and doing very well. House wine is cheap and good, appetizers (warm funghi salad) excellent, but my steak frites was way overdone and piled atop what looked like frozen fries. My wife's pasta ($17) was, she said, very good. Our shared dessert--a lime tart--was excellent. So overall, pretty good.	neutral
What a gem!!  My husband and I LOVE Pallucci.If you're lucky enough to get Chris (and most are) service is a 5.!  He knows his stuff, is happy to recommend, and sets a great pace for your meal.  Ambiance is cozy and comfortable - never too loud.  Food is excellent!  So much to recommend.  The sweet potato fries with balsamic glaze are a must.  The funghi salad is sooooo good, and my husband swears by the caprese with bocconcini.  Last time we went I had the tuna spacial and it was delicious!!  Everything is fresh and prepared to your liking.This is a great neighborhood spot......give it a try!	good
3.5 stars!I went here with my gf because she had a craving for risotto and I hear this restaurant made some good ones.  We started with the caprese salad and squid salad.  They were both excellent but the squid portion was a bit small. Still tasted fantastic.  Then she had a beef and mushroom risotto which was pretty damn good.  Dessert was also fantastic, the creme brûlée inside was custardy and the top crispy as it should be.  If you want good food they have it but my only issue was the lack of people, especially on a Friday night.	neutral
Small, yet cozy relaxing place.  I thought it was a bit small, so if you have a group of 8 friends gettin together for dinner, i dont think this is the best place for you.  Food was pretty good. A lil' on the pricey side- $32 for Tuna dish-a price in which the server failed to mentioned- or maybe t'was my fault not to ask, or was I even supposed to be asking for the price? err.... My friend had some meat dish for about $34..Anyways, the service was nice- didnt have to wait 2 hrs for the foods to arrive, so that was good. Although, my tuna came out somewhat too salty, but the dinner rolls made up for it. Their thin-cut fries were amazing- reminded me of the way my grandma used to make fries for us- home fried french fries mmMMmmm Will I go back? um.maybe. And i will be sure to order the foods w/ the prices are shown.	neutral
I have only ordered delivery from this location. The pizza is great tasting, like any other pizza hut I've been to. My issues have been regarding my orders. More often than not they forget something in my order. Once it was a 2L bottle of pop, and quite a few times it's been my dipping sauce. I currently have a credit on my pizza hut account for free dipping sauce for the next time I order. I order here about twice a month and I can understand forgetting once or twice but it seems like it's every other time now. The food does arrive hot and on time though, which is a plus.	neutral
Terrible service. I called to have a pizza delivered at 9:40pm, it is now 10:26 and we haven't gotten a call nor did we receive our order from this location. Worst service in the world!!!!!!!	bad
This just in! This dirty dirty chain 'za (but come on... the crust is like deep-fried) location now has $7 walk-in specials before 4pm Mon-Wednesday. You know you want to hit it. Now I'm going to go wash my soul...	good
"It's my local chippy, and I stopped by there after arriving on the last train back from St Andrews, the other night. It did the job, but it was far from good.Overall, we said: ""the Clifton wins for proximity but not for quality. When chippy longing sets in, this is often the way. In future, I'll aim to point my deep-fried lust in the direction of L'Alba D'Oro or La Campagnola, both of which are excellent. My hunger was well and truly destroyed, but it was not a terribly satisfying experience. I look forward to more successful ""retoxing"" missions."""	bad
"No no no no! Where do I start, perhaps slapping myself in the face for not having read the only other review on this place BEFORE crossing the threshold of the Clifton Fish Bar. To cut a long story short, I ordered a pizza with salami, peppers, mushrooms and anchovies. Simple. 45 mins later I received a pizza with peppers and anchovies. On quizzing the (grumpy) guy behind the counter as to the invisible ingredients i had ordered and paid for, he told me they didn't have any mushrooms or salami left. ""Then why didn't you tell me this small, insignificant fact at the time i ordered, or subsequent 45 mins whilst I was in your shop?""...no reply other than a look of get outa my shop. Appalling. And how was the pizza you ask? Don't know, ask the rubbish bin not far from his shop.If I could give 0 stars for this place, I would."	bad
This is a very tough place to review, seeing as I have only been there once and that was a good while ago and I found that it was like any other standard chippy. The chips were not great, but didn't taste like cardboard, which is a bonus, and the smoked sausage was fine. However, Clifton Fish Bar was last year fined for poor hygiene during a standard hygiene test. On hearing this news, I felt a bit sick that I had actually eaten there as the test had found dead mice and mice droppings in the shop.However, it must be noted that subsequent to this, the shop has cleaned its act up and although the owner says that he was not aware of any mouse problem, he has put in measures to make sure that such an issue will not arise in the future.It must be hard for a business to regain its reputation after such an issue, but the best thing that it does do is give you confidence that the place is now clean.	bad
Biggest wantons I have ever seen!!! Broth is good too. The fried rice is amazing, the sweet and sour chicken sauce is thinner than most places but it's still amazing. The fortunes in the cookie need work thou.	good
Excellent food. We found it on the GPS from the Interstate. Good Service and good prices. Clean. Doesn't look like much from the outside.	good
By far one of my favorites for pork fried rice and chicken and broccoli they have great egg rolls too	good
This place has really good Chinese food everytime I go I order the sweet and sour chicken which is really good also the General Tso's chicken which is excellent and their boneless ribs excellent It's not expensive and the portions that they give you are pretty big. Their soups are good for wonton soup excellent. The staff there is very nice and the restaurant is very clean.	good
If I would rather repeatedly shoot myself in the junk with frozen paintball pellets than go to a certain bar, then you know it must have a lot going for it.	bad
Once in a while the girls and I will feel the need to nurture our wild hair .....and this is the place to do it!!I'm the kind of girl that needs to dance-off a cocktail so this is the right place to get it out of my system. Barcelona has brought new meaning to 'people-watching'...over the years I have watched the growth and success of plastic surgery while frequenting Barcelona....business must be booming here!!!I will admit that I have celebrated a few good times here in great company of my best of friends - and this place will always be our FUN hang to 'shake it'.Get there before 10pm when the crowds start to form - you will get your warm up walking to the front entrance from where you parked your car!!...And guys....SORRY that they make you wait in a separate line around the back side!! Has any man ever complained about this??!!	good
We can't stop here... This is cougar country!Seriously, this is such a cougar's den. Not just that, but this place has the biggest infestation of douche bags. You need a gas mask just to cut through the Axe, bronzer, and fumes of hair gel that linger throughout the air. If you want a visual of what this place looks like on the weekend, take a gander at: www.hotchickswithdouchebags.com . Click it. It's a real site and it's what this place and its patrons looks like. If you model your style of dress and behavior after VH1 reality shows, drop in for a swig and some high-fives from your fellow date rapists. If not, just pray in thanks that Scottsdale is where it's at and everything you love is where it is.There's a live band that plays and I'm not a fan, mainly because it's not my type of music. They play alot of butt rock and the like... basically stuff you'd expect a cruise ship band to have jam sessions to in about 20 years.The only reason I'm giving this place 1 star as opposed to none (if that were an option) is that the staff is pretty good. They tend to see that everything is going good and do a good job of bringing what you've ordered on time. Lastly, I feel bad for alot of the waitresses. How they put up with a crowd that takes pointers from episodes of Rock of Love and Tool Academy, I will never know.	bad
very awkward place, if you are above the age of 40 looking for a place to have a drink then maybe this is the place for you...	bad
"I guess I was here twice, maybe a 3rd time, but there is some fog in between the memory and me. Barcelona was praised to me as the best thing since sliced bread, Blue Martini and Star Trek together (dont have to tell you they all s...).As I am admittedly claustrophobic I enjoyed the outdoor space majorly. The drinks were good and strong, but I dont know about the prices. I was there with a Detroit crowd (I guess all of Detroit moves to Phx) and for some reason I didnt have to pay for anything. Music was ok, nothing special, just the usual crowd pleasers and some people, mostly MILFS and GILFS (think about it) tried to dance. Gosh, please, white people, dont dance. I know, I am white, but there is a reason I date Latinas only! Mmm, what about if I am a woman and go there - how would I rate the guyz? - besides one really normal and nice guy who hit on one of my female friends - I would probably puke on the dance floor. Overall scene: douches and DDs. Nothing special at all.Btw: While girls go out to ""DANCE"" with their girls, we guys do not go out to just ""DANCE"" with our buddies!"	neutral
Disclosure: I wasn't here for the nightly festivities and therefore can't rate the nightclub experience. I did not eat at the restaurant either. So I cannot rate that.  Barcelona is aesthetically pleasing. The people who designed and decorated this place did a commendable job. We sat on the plush patio couches, puffed our cigars and had a few drinks. The service was above average. We had a great time and enjoyed being here. We left a little after the evening crowd started getting in. The clientele appeared to be a mix of men and women with an average age in the mid-40s. They were mostly well dressed and respectable looking. Barcelona is definitely a high end establishment and if dropping Benjamins is not your thing then this is not the place for you.	good
"Barcelona has the worst way of letting people know that they're closed until mid-September!Everything was still up like they are still open, website, myspace, all with no indication of their closing. So yea, if you really want to piss me off that's the way to do it, be misleading and secretive about your business temporary closing. Supposedly, we were referred to PCL and someplace else, and were told to tell them that Barcelona sent us and they'd ""take care"" of us. Unless I'm getting free bottle service to make up for this blunder, I'm not interested!"	bad
Sutra no longer offers 50% off on Tuesday nights... but Barcelona does.So, that's where we found ourselves meeting some friends tonight for dinner and drinks.It was a beautiful evening, so we sat outside on the patio.  We went back and forth on using the heat lamps provided.  Chelsea was our server and she was sweet as can be but perhaps a tad bit on the ditzy side.  The guys seemed to admire looking at her (bustier) every time she leaned over the table, and I was nervous something was going to pop out.Aside from that entertainment, the food was decent.  It was not amazing.  I had the chopped salad which was pretty good and big enough to share, followed by the sea bass (no surprise there) entree.  Jared had an 8 oz filet and Zack had a ribeye.  We all shared spinach and sweet potato fries as sides, and the guys each had dessert.  I didn't have any (ahem - wedding diet), but they seemed to be orgasming over the chocolate lava cake... the cheese cake and berry dessert also went over well at the table.With the 50% off Tuesday special, this was $30 per person with tip.  For the amount of food we got, this was a deal, but had we payed full price? Not so much... If I return, it will be on a Tuesday night for the 1/2 off special.  Other than that, I'm not really interested.	neutral
Lions and cougars and manthers! Oh my! Yep. I might as well have been on a safari....the cougars we're thick as thieves. We were here for an event and this joint was jumpin'! Thankfully, it must hold 10,000 people...it is enormous. Lots of different rooms, patios and lounges for the cougars to make their attack. I had VIP service so I can't complain about that. The food was a buffet and was actually quite good. Of course I could have eaten a dish rag and been happy as I needed something to soak up the free Patron. Yep. Free Patron. The crowd was typical for this neck of Scottsdale. Hello stereotype! Could you be any more accurate. I had fun mingling, people watching and leaving. Yep. Leaving. We made a quick escape after I was called a fag in the bathroom by some gelled up, steroided out cardboard head dude. Sorry, just cuz I tried to share a urinal with him. Jeez! What's up with that. Some people are so territorial! I'd go here again, for an event, but never, never for a night out. Adios Barcelona!	bad
All I have to say is......W.....T......F?Scene: 6 people in their early to mid 20's walks into Barcelona. Half of them from New York, the other half from San Francisco (or San Fran as the folks in Scottsdale likes to say). Their mouths have dropped and they sit in udder amazement. A band from 1994 gets up on stage and tries to get the crowd of 40 year olds going.  With every song played, the folks from separate coasts, just stand there in complete shock....and then THEY DRANK because THEY HAD TO!This place is oh so bad! OH SO BAD!!! Go if you need a good laugh.	bad
"Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it bestActually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say ""you mean the one in Scottsdale"" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back..."	bad
I love it.  Being new to the whole club scene in AZ,  I love it!  Its so spacious, you can hang out either outdoors and indoors (I love this the most!!),  lots of fun and good looking people and the cosmo there is yummy!  I can't wait to go here again!!	good
"Bills itself as trendy, upscale supper club.  The food was good and the service so-so. The one thing that stands out was the ""southwestern"" lobster bisque.  No mention of anything other than regular lobster bisque, but was suprised to find corn in my bisque. Call me old fashioned but I don't like chewing my bisque. My steak from what I remembered was decent. A little pricey for the atmosphere. Can't take the food too seriously when the music is blaring so loudly."	neutral
"Bad ass bar!  huge Club!  Very Very hip! the Decor is awesome! it had a line that wrapped around the block.  babes everywhere.  very cool crowd.  They had a hip hop group playing live, they really rocked the house, and the DJ in between sets he was was awesome.   Dance floor was gigantic!  we got a table and our own ""mixologist""?!  pretty cool.  super entertaining.  Words will not do it justice, it was an experience!  I know nothing about the food here but for partying it was awesome!"	good
Damn, if this is not the perfect place to meet women. I read some reviews about cougars, well I like milf's. For one, for this fantasy to come true it better happen soon as, I am 36 years old, and the age I prefer to date for long term decreases by the minute. Anyway, this place has people of all ages that is what I liked best. I do wish they had a place of this caliber in the bay area then I wouldnt be single. Then, again, I never met a girl friend at a bar. Anyway, Arizona women are better than Miami. The jury is still out on Texas which most of my guy friends seem to say are the top of the states. Arizona women are amazing.  Okay, back to barcelona if you want to indoor lounge they got it, want to hang out outside got it, want to dance on the dance floor got it. Whatever type of person you are, this is a great place to go if you are the type who can make your own fun.	good
So..this place is cute!  Huge dance floor!  The whole place is huge! Geesh~  Fun decor and nice bartenders.  The guys there seem pretty lame though.  Cool place to get dressed up and dance.	neutral
Barcelona is pretty swanky, there's no doubt about that.  The decor is upscale, with a cascading fountain running down a wall of pottery, jars and other items right when you first walk in the doors.  This is definitely the secret hiding place of sugar daddies and their 21 year old girlfriends, as well as 50 year old women that have been botox-ed to the point that they now look like painfully taut 35 year olds.  Despite all of this, I like Barcelona.  The dance floor is always packed and they play pretty good music.  Personally, I'd rather listen to a good DJ than a semi-cheesy cover band, but hey- I can't win them all.  I made the mistake of coming here for their New Year's 4-course dinner and I still regret it.  The food wasn't good enough for the price and I almost lost an eye when our waiter tried to open our bottle of champagne.  All in all, I think Barcelona can be a fun night spot but I prefer Old Town Scottsdale night clubs to this one.	neutral
"So, up until tonight, I've primarily used Yelp as a dating website. A girl thinks my picture is kinda cute. I write reviews that demonstrate I passed high school English. She writes/compliments me... I'm cocky/funny. I offer to explore downtown with her. She turns me down. I try the next girl. Same result. But the intent is always there. After this review, I doubt I'll have to worry about succeeding with any woman who ever reads this review ever again. So check it out. I'm a male slut. If I meet you in person and I lay my lines on you and smile in this certain way that I've discovered makes women look away and blush, you'll definitely give me your number and probably go home with me within one more encounter. That's my M.O. It works. If it ain't broke... I'm not altogether proud of the man I've become but I'm not going to stop either. From what I've gathered from movies and television, my life is fairly wonderful. Unless me writing about it causes some cosmic/karmic shift and I get disfigured in a car accident tomorrow and lose my mojo, I have several strong years of carousing left in me.  Ok, all that said, I've been reading on Yelp about all the ""cougars"" who frequent this lovely establishment. I define a ""cougar"" not by age, but as a woman who knows what she wants (me). So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole. We've been there twice in the last two weeks. Guess how many woman we've taken home or who have taken us to their homes in the last two weeks? Four. Guess how many we've given The Business to... The same four. Guess what our batting average is... .1000Usually, I need to take a woman out one more time before The Business is exchanged. Sometimes more if she's particularly prudish. Barcelona is where The Business is the understood currency. I like The Business. So if you're reading this and you think I'm scum, I used to be you. I've ""evolved."" If you're reading this and you're a woman who knows what she wants, shoot me a message. And if you're reading this you think I'm lying because you didn't get laid last time you went there, I am willing to show you how. But you'd never take my advice because you don't believe me or think you'll succeed next time on your own or think I'm an ass for writing this and you don't want to meet me on principle. I don't blame you. I feel dirty. But just a little. Mostly smug."	good
"Every bar I have ever walked into has had an alarmingly poor ratio of men to women (too many men and not enough women). I have often wondered if every bar has too many men, there must be one place where all of the women go. Where is that place? That question was once rhetorical. It turns out, in Scottsdale, Arizona, that place is Barcelona's. We were seated early in the section that is cleared out to make way for a dance floor as later in the night Zooey Boey takes the stage. We started with a few appetizers, of which my clear favorite was the macadamia nut encrusted shrimp; they were incredibly good (I do not even like macadamia nuts). The portions were more than generous for each person at the table. I had the bone-in-ribeye which came with a Bearnaise sauce on the side that was very good. They serve a molten chocolate desert that was heavenly on a soft bed of ice cream. We all left extremely full and even more satisfied with the meal. The place is a little pricey, but Barcelona's is easily my new ""go-to"" restaurant in Scottsdale. Attire is casual through professional. Barcelona's is located on the Greenway-Hayden Loop east of Scottsdale Road. I can't wait to get back."	good
"Is it pronounced ""Bath-elona"" like the football club?Mes que un ClubTrendy, flash, done.Clearly this place does not follow the same motto as the football club.This is pretty much a standard ho/bro spot.  Fun, but I'm not really that into it.  Cool place in moderation.CheersUntil then, get the beers in..."	neutral
"I recently visited AZ, stayed at the JW Marriott and every single staff person I spoke to said we should party at Barcelona. It started sounding like there was some sort of arrangement between the owners. Being that I'm vegetarian, we decided that this wasn't the place for dinner. So we didn't really end up here until almost 11pm.The music was great! I loooooooooooved it. The creepy old guys were... creepy. But the bartenders and waitresses were awesome, the drinks were nummy and i loved the outdoor area with the ""cabanas."" Would definitely recommend this place for partying!"	neutral
I've never been here personally, but from what I've heard- go here to have drinks and dance...not to eat. Too loud for dinner, and not worth the money.	good
So the guys are a little older.  What dont you people understand about free drinks?  I walked into this place on Friday night and was offered a shot of patron before I even got through the entry.  God Bless Barcelona.  This place has been reviewed so much so I'll stick to the basics:Its huge.Lots of comfortable couches/tables/standing room.Dance floor thats really really packed.Cover band.  Think Zowie Bowie but lame.  OldER crowd, but not creepy-old and not too-poor-to-buy-girls-a-drink old.  Great table/bottle/VIP serviceAWESOME, spacious, asthetically pleasing, modern bathrooms with an attendant.  No lines.No cover for girls, $10 for dudes.In summary, aside from the really bad band (if you can even call them that, they just sig over popular music...music that I like, but the singers are so cheesy and weird it freaks me out), I loved Barcelona.  Definitely worth the 15 minute road trip north from Old Town.	good
"i enjoy Barcelona.when i moved to Scottsdale, AZ, this was he first bar i went to.  It was right down the street from where I lived (which ended up being a great location).  all of the greatest friends i made during my year there i met here and im still in touch with today,i normally dont get into that whole ""club"" scene...but i always had a blast when i was there.  i do have to say i would never go there looking for a Mr.  if i was single.  i don't care for Scottsdale men, they are WANNABE's, drive their BMW's yet live with like 6 other roommates just so they can AFFORD that BMW.  If there was a section on Yelp about Scottsdale men, i don't think there would be enough room for my negative opinion.  this place is full of them YES.  But like i said, the service is great, i loved my bartender James.  and i always had a BLAST when i was there.i miss you Barcelona. xoxo"	good
WARNING: COUGAR CROSSING!If you are a young man and want to get down with an older, nice looking woman- go here.  Everyone else... don't bother!	bad
Muchas gracias to Geetah and Hank for taking little 'ol out-of-towner me to Barcelona.Given it being a Thursday, the place was packed.  Best way to describe this place is amazing Spanish decor on a large scale.  The outdoor patio is perfect for warm days/nights and the interior is typical of Scottsdale architecture: new, modern with airplane hanger height ceilings and furnished with beautiful furniture and warm tones.Dare I say it?  It's actually better than places in S.F.  *sniff*I expected country bumpkins (Sorry!  My first time in Phoenix.  Had to trudge over for work.) but found a Laguna Beach/Costa Mesa atmosphere (sans the ocean) in the middle of the desert.The crowd's friendly, male-to-female ratio balanced and we even snagged some boxing tickets from a nice guy walking around.  Does it get any better than that?I heard Brittany and Jess head to this place when they're in town...but you may/may not want to disclose that info.The only drawback to the Scottsdale/Phoenix scene is the distance between one venue to the next.  Imagine yourself driving through the suburbs and going to expansive strip malls (p.c. version would be lifestyle complexes) for action.  Oh, and maybe too many golf shirts walking around late at night.  Go during happy hour for the best crowd.	good
No doubt that this is Scottsdale's ultimate cougar den. I ended up here two nights in a row because it has a huge outdoor area, it's easy to move around, and hey if a cougar wants sink her teeth into me, and she hasn't escaped from a geriatric home then I wont hold it against her.	neutral
"edited to add: CLOSED! GOOD!my folks went to Barcelona for Valentine's Day and it was HORRIBLE.First of all, they put the valet parking in the middle of the parking lot. WTF? I thought you paid for valet so you didn't have to walk!The meal was terrible. Paella - shell bits in it. My mom got sick from the seafood, as soon as she got home she had terrible runs and felt horrible the next day.My father likes pepper on his food. They asked for some pepper, a guy came by and gave a quick twist with the pepper grinder and BAM! he was gone.Well he wanted more pepper so when they FINALLY flagged down the waitress, they asked for more pepper. She brought them a pepper shaker. :-(The pepper shaker wasn't working right for my father, he could not get anything out of it, Danny himself came by and asked how things were. My father told him he couldn't get the pepper shaker to work. Danny said, ""Great, I'm glad to hear it!"" and left. WTF?oh and when some apparent VIPs came in, my folks were completely ignored.They dropped nearly $300 there! What a joke. If you want a good meal, AVOID Barcelona."	bad
This was Barcelona in Chandler, so I can imagine what the Hayden location would be like...  You know what it's like on that side of town...	bad
Barcelona was a great restaurant years ago and had the best paella in Scottsdale. Today, Barcelona is supposed to be a club scene, but in actuality, it's fairly empty. This place lost its focus and reminds me of Maestro's in the OC.	bad
I will say one thing about Barcelona. It is spacious, so for all the claustrophobic people out there, you'll definitely not feel like a sardine in a tin can. I love how you have your options open - if you'd like to feel the sultry summer breeze, or lack of, you can sit outside, or if you are freezing you can go to the main building, and dance your drunk ass off. Yes, the live band's slightly cheesy, but when you're inebriated, who cares? Caution, for cougar lovers, there are a lot prowling around, waiting to sink their claws in young meat. I've never had the opportunity to eat there, so I can't say anything in regards to food. This is definitely not for people who are going out, expecting to meet a ton of young people, and surround yourself with recent college graduates. Yes, there is diversity. I've seen young to extremely old. I've met my share of extremely weird characters, like this man who was trying to pull girls from the dance floor or the bar, to share the VIP experience with his son who was celebrating his birthday. It sort of felt like he was trying to pimp us out to his son, but that's a different story all together. Barcelona's is a cougar's den, and the drinks aren't satisfactory for the wallet, but I do emphasize how I love the spaciousness of this place! I suppose that's the only reason I enjoy it, anyway. I usually relax outside, and the dancing side of me doesn't come into action here. With the live band, it's hard to shake my moneymaker, anyway.	bad
"GR8 Happy HrPosh InteriorAmazing Outdoor PatioGood ServiceLUV AppiesDon't usually stay late, BUT eye candy all around ""if"" u doDance floor, BUSY @ wkndsLike it best @ 5/6pm venue - in or out side :-)"	good
This is your go-to place if you are visiting from out of town for golfing and are over 30. When I've gone I've seen more well dressed cougars looking for a dance than you could shake a stick at. However, this place isn't just for people over the hill, its fun for all ages. A fine establishment.	neutral
"This place sucked. First of all, as an out of towner- I have never seen so many old fake orange women in my life. I felt like I was in an episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County: Scottsdale Edition. I am just bitter because I came here for a joyous occasion of a wedding VIP party, but I was denied access at the door because I was wearing tennis shoes. Gimme a break, my shoes weren't some  salvation army shoes. They were quite expensive ""plaid original chucks"" that had character and style. They still denied me in after I complained saying I have never had a problem in LA, SF, NY, VEGAS but clearly Scottsdale I do.  Anyways, after the $10 cover charge, they gave me a ticket for a free fish taco or something. Sick. I don't want to eat fish tacos at 11pm. This place reminded me of Cheesecake Factory after dark. Everyone is old. They don't have a DJ, instead they have a band that does bad covers of bad songs like ""Wind it Up"" and ""Glamorous"". Worst part? I saw old guys wearing phat farm tennis shoes and mandals. How the hell are mandals allowed at a club but trendy kicks aren't?Avoid this place at all costs unless you want to get picked up by a lonely horny housewife of Scottsdale. The themesong to this place should be Nelly's MANEATER."	bad
I have actually never eaten here and from what I've heard I'm not missing out. I haven't noticed as many cougars here as everyone else. I tend to see more barely legal females with men who could be their fathers or grandfathers. But anyway, I always have a great time at this place. Yes, the dance floor gets extremely crowed, but the band is great!Most of the guys here adhere to the following dress code: Spiky hair, orange tan and Ed Hardy or Affliction t-shirts.Most of the girls here adhere to the following dress code: Spiky heels and not much else.It's a great place to people watch.	neutral
I'm being nice with 2 stars.  This place is overrated.  I heard this was the hot spot to hang out in Phoenix...NOT!  I was visiting from out of town and there is absolutely NOTHING special about this place.  The food was nothing to brag about and the place in general as well.	bad
Ok, I have been here personally...  If you're meeting someone for drinks it's okay.  Almost always crowded with pretentious people, the dance floor is tiny, the food is average and everything is expensive...	neutral
If you are a beautiful person or aspire to be near same, I'd tack on another star. If you're hungry, I'd probably take one off.	neutral
"I wish I could give this zero stars, in the sense that this place is not negative or positive, it just Is. Barcelona is the simultaneously the most awesome and the very worst club I've ever been to.There's some sort of Zen shit going on in this space where I should have been having the worst time of my life, but instead I was madly in love with this bar and its motley crew of inhabitants. The ""band"" is wildly entertaining yet I also want to open up on them with a flame thrower.The men are equal parts hot and cheesy.The drinks are strong but taste awful.I would go here once a month if I lived in Scottsdale, as a sort of barometer for...something. As long as I know a place like Barcelona still exists, I know that the universe still holds mysteries that I'm not ready to comprehend.But you'd have to be fucking nuts to eat here."	good
Four stars for the drink special (can't quite remember what it was but that's a good thing right?)Love being outdoors and although it can be a bit trendy/cheesy, perhaps that's my elitist side coming out.  Damn me for living in a great city like SF and getting spoiled!  Being outdoors at night is nice though!	good
Massive Scottsdale scene - fake rich guys and plastic women.  Went here for a business meeting and we both ordered steaks which came out extremely rare and had to be sent back.  The waiter forgot other stuff and the food was mediocre at best considering the prices.  The restaurant is run very strangely ... bouncer type guys with ear piece walkie talkie things come around every 15 minutes to make sure everything is going OK ... but in a harassing way.  This place may be heaven for some, but if gaudy large scale club atmospheres with an annoying crowd ain't your thang... stay away.	bad
Oh Barcelona, I visited you with low expectations - and you didn't disappoint.A lovely young woman of my recent acquaintance invited me here recently for the purpose of attending a birthday party for a friend of hers. Neither of us would have come here otherwise. If you're thinking about going, don't do it. If you care for the deets, read on. If not, stop reading here and.... go somewhere else. Please. We show up at about 8 for drinks and dinner. I wasn't in a drinking mood, my date's Appletini was pretty Appley but the amount of liquor was tini. Must be why they call it an Appletini. Hm. Highlight was the bread brought to the table - the pretzel rolls were the highlight of the evening. How sad is that?Now... the place is called Barcelona. Barcelona is a city in Spain. THe closest thing to a Spanish dish on the menu us Paella, otherwise it's a steakhouse menu with a few obligatory pasta dishes. Totally uninspired.I ordered the ribeye, medium rare. It came out medium, and the glaze and whatever else they put on it were awful, save the two onion rings. I doubt this was USDA prime beef. It just wasn't that good, and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what I was eating. The shoestring fries side were a pleasant surprise - a giant mound of crispy potato. My date had some kind of pasta with shrimp dish. The shrimp were overdone, the pasta was, ok. Denny's pasta is OK, too, and let's face it, so is Chef Boyardee... So don't read too much into the complement. Barcelona. Spain. The place doesn't look that Spanish on the inside. There is a giant mural on the ceiling, dim lights, it reminds me more of Las Vegas cheese than Spain. While you dine, there are two Scottsdouche (or is it Douchedale?) types crooning back and forth to each other on stage. Is this where failed American Idol contestants try to relive their moment of glory? I don't know. They made a reappearance later, singing along with a DJ to a selection of bad 90's pop music with the occasional 80's party jam. The crowd is douchey. The food is awful and on the pricey side. The service, spotty. If you're coming for the thing Barcelona is famous for, you'll find a lot of it. If not, stay away. Far, far away.	bad
I must admit, I'm a tiny bit embarrassed that I LOVE this place.  When a group of us girls get together, pull out the party dresses, and break out the spray tans this is where we go!  First off, the place is huge with a large patio, so there's always somewhere to walk around and grab a drink (unlike PCL and SIX....too small and you only have room to stand there awkwardly until you've had 3 or 10 drinks).  The band, Envy, is the best thing about the place.....the 2 good looking guys and the cute girl put a ton of energy into performing top 40 stuff.   On top of that, the people watching......wow.  There's a big age range from 20's to 50's, and yes, the cougars are on the prowl and there are creepy guys a plenty.  That's part of the entertainment!  I haven't eaten here, so the 5 stars is definitely for a Friday or Saturday night out.	good
Barcelona is what Scottsdale is all about.  The best place to go for drinks, listen to music and people watch.  And the happy hour lasts until around 9p!  My friend and I had about 10 berrs and I think our bill was about $30.About 10 of us went for New Year's Eve 2006 we had dinner and entry to the club for $75/pp.I love the outdoor patio.  The staff are very polite.  Its just a fun place to go!	good
"I've only had 'good times' @ Barcelona so I have very few complaints about the joint.  There is definitely an eclectic mix of people that go there but I think that's what makes it fun.  I met an Eastern European fighter, slow danced to Sinatra with the owner of a foreign auto dealership, and encountered a funny old man who must've been about 90 that somehow got on stage to shake his groove thang with the female singer.  He later came to our table and after my friend complimented his dance moves, he blew in her ear and said ""You know what that was?  I just gave you a blow job.""  Whoa--LOL!I do agree that it's strange to buy drinks in the ladies room and that some chicks seem to lounge on the couch in there, checkin out other chicks when they walked through the door.  I felt like I was bein judged before a panel, whenever I passed the couch!  And I haven't seen the cougars but have definitely come across my disproportionate share of the 'J. Howard Marshall' types.  All in all, the only reason I can't give this place 4 stars is b/c of the outrageous drink prices."	good
Plain and simple this place sucks! The food was disgusting and the waiter wasn't able to give me any details on what was on the menu. This so called high end restaurant had some stuck up hostess and waitress. I ordered a steak medium rare, I was given a burnt piece of meat. I ordered lobster bisque and was given sloppy with butter in my soup and it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten. This place can't do food or entertainment. The entertainment was called Envy. What a joke! They can't sign but apparently every overly tanned person in Arizona think they are wonderful. No accounting for taste. If you go to Scottsdale, take a pass on this place...its overpriced. What they spent on pretty building they should have spent on training staff and getting an actual DJ! Or and they should invest in a better chef.	bad
Ok, so the atmosphere is great here in terms of being upscale, but there are some negatives.1.  Cougars on the prowl - lots of hot, old women who are on the prowl for younger guys....they are full of botox and silicone.  I guess this isn't always a negative, as it does help boost ones ego, but sometimes the way that they are desperate is sort of lame.2.  BBQ - If you're sitting outside on the patio, prepare to smell like BBQ chicken after you are done.  I don't know who designed this, but it was pretty poor engineering.  You don't build a BBQ in the middle of the lounge, so that your patrons get smoke in their faces.3.  Fancy Cars - Sure I love Ferrari's just as much as the next guy, but the fact that they put them in the front is sort of lame....like they're trying too hard to make themselves look uber-cool.4.  Lounge singers - they have had the same lounge singers, singing the same songs for years.  I thought that the girl was hot, but she's more of a Monet (good from afar, but all messed up when looking up close)All in all, I give them a 3 for entertainment value (humor).  This isn't exactly the best nightclub in the world though.	neutral
It might even be worth it for the spectacle of it all - both the massive size of the place, and for the comical people-watching.  It's good for some chuckles, at least!	neutral
"Snotsdale at its finest! This place is a large bar/night club that was built by Danny, of Danny's car wash fame, who made millions keeping cars clean against the dust storms and monsoons of the Valley of the Sun, and needed a good place where he could go dancing with his woman. It actually is a restaurant, too. The food is Ok. The Paella is huge and not bad. They try real hard to make this place the chi-chi joint for the hip resort/snowbird crowd. It is huge, with several dining areas and bars, a large patio, and a small stage and decent dance floor. They usually have live music on the weekends and intersperse with Disco DJs. On weekends you have cowgirls walking around with their ""shooters"" holsters and shot glasses thru the 4 bars. A lot of the waitresses (not just here, but in most of Snotsdale's higher end joints) are part time ASU coeds trying to make a buck to buy more short skirts and halter tops at the mall. Everyone at night is pretty much trying to create an impression beyond their true reality, whether it is the young diggers or the old farts. If you are from Dallas or Calgary, you will probably like this place for its unapologetic panash for conspicouus consumption.  The food and drinks are overpriced; the eye candy plentiful; and reality is far, far away. Bring your Cheesehead friends from Wisconsin in November and they will be impressed."	neutral
Cougars are on the prowl at this north Scottsdale nightspot. You'll find women in their 40s scamming on guys who could be their sons! You'll also see the 50-year-old guys flaunting their arm candy -- a younger woman half their age! The people watching is part of the fun at this spacious dance club which features a martini lounge and supper club.Drinks are pricey. The cover band is pretty cheesy and the singer looks as if she could be an adult star on the side. If you find yourself at Barcelona, duck into La Rouge. It's a cute martini bar where you can get away from the madness of the patio and the dance floor.	neutral
This is a great place to dance and mingle. The band Envy plays good songs and the crowd is always pumping. Older crowd but still a lot of fun. I'm actually going there tonight, can't wait. One of my favorite nightclubs in the Valley.	good
Interesting concept....dine, entertainment, dance club - all packed into one building.  Reminds me of the life style of Barcelona where first seating begins no earlier than 9 pm....visual stimulation galore, food a-ok for the one stop convenience.  No firsthand review of the dancing portion.Worth checking out if in Scottsdale.	neutral
I'm gonna go four stars because after reading the reviews, you're sort of ready for what you get, and they are selling a pretty specific experience.  It's the super-be-everything-bar that is like Disneyland for adults.  We're a bar, no we're a restaurant, no we're a club, wait we're also a lounge, and did I mention we're a jazz spot?  The list goes on.  But you know, they sort of do a decent job of all of it and it's kind of crazy to see all the different sorts a joint like this attracts. (point: great people watching)So the huge Vegas like-ness of the place make up for the not bad, but not great food and at the same time, the service was solid.  They were out of the lobster I ordered but they substituted and took care of the inconvenience.	good
On my on-going quest for reasonably-priced and delicious Indian food in the Chandler area, a friend and I checked this place out tonight.  The decor is sketchy, to say the least.  When we got there (just after 7pm) we were the only people there.  Paper place mats, folded paper menus, not necessarily the cleanest cutlery I've ever seen.  Service was poor.  The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.Not the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.The food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.  I would go back and eat just that any time.  I probably won't come back here, although it was decent.  Still not exactly what I'm looking for.	neutral
The food is pretty good here, especially the various biryanis they make. They change their items on the buffet each time, they told me.  My kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  I asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.The downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal. Since they are so confused and can't be bothered to give menus or post the prices and ages, we probably won't go back often.	neutral
Its Friday night, and it's a 1st date night, so I got to pick the place, and I had already confessed my Yelp obsession, but really is it an obsession when you are continually finding the best of places within your area? Yelp hasn't led me wrong yet...but anyways, I had wanted to try Matka, was starting to see the reviews and thought oh it's time to check this place out! When I suggested it he said yea sounds good.  That right their gave him some points, cuz it's normally my girlfriends that I talk into going with me to try new ethnic cuisines.So got their around 6:30pm, Date looked cute & fly! We walked inside and saw we were one of the 1st people there, the owner, who was present was very friendly and helpful with everything. The place is very cute on the inside; I think we were early, because we had decided on trying out the dinner buffet to try a little bit of everything, and the owner asked us to give him a few mins to get all the serving spoons out. No problem we stayed at our table and sat and talked,  then owner said its ready! Oh yea baby I was starving and ready to go!I tried a cauliflower dish, don't know what it was called but god it was good! Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi? Man that too was packed with little bit of heat, but not in a bad way, those 2 dishes might even get me to be a vegetarian for maybe a hour or so, um maybe not because I then spotted the butter chicken in that creamy orange sauce and the chili chicken with big slices of jalapenos and though who can live on veggie alone! Both the butter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too.  Meal and Date were perfect! It was a good night!Also side note, my date tried the goat biryani and thought it to be spicy and told the owner, who tried it and said yea it's on the spicy side, will make up a new batch right now, now to me that's excellent service!   I hope to see Matka stays around because I sure do plan on coming back!	good
Tried this place on 4th of July, decent amount of folks eating there that day.Had the Palak Chicken which was good flavor, green sauce with spinach.  We also ordered Poori bread, which had big bubbles that were fun to poke at.  Since it was fried, the kids loved the crunchy top.  Hubby had the Lamb Vindaloo which was spicy and really good flavor, red sauce with lots of good spice.  The food is a little spicy, but we like spicy!  One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us.Also had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh.  Recently, I was disappointed to find out this restaurant received a D from the county's health service, big turn off for any future return.  We hadn't planned on it anyway because the bill was too high for 2 entrees, one extra side of bread and a drink.	bad
Went for their lunch buffet this afternoon.  The floor of the restaurant had stuff strewn all over- a turn off when you're there to eat, and fail to see how they couldn't have the waitstaff sweep the place in less than 10 mins.  There was only 1 other family dining, so clearly they weren't swamped.  There were many dishes which included South Indian and North India.  The paneer was just not right, too much tomato sauce and store bought paneer doesn't amount to great tasting butter paneer.  The chicken dishes were average to below average.  The dessert was horrible - runny mango custard, tasteless fried sweet bread.There was zero ambience.  It was very 'store like'. I wish all the restaurants around could take a cue or two from 'Chutneys' in Tempe.  They have excellent tasting food, great ambience (because they actually employed an interior designer to do up their restaurant) and great prices.  Their flavors are unmatched. A $12.99 buffet needs to be worth that much, and I'm sorry, but Matka isn't worth it, but Chutneys totally is.	bad
Saw an empty resturant from outside. Anyway went inside.. It was hotter inside than outside. Papad was cold and old..Sent it back. The food was expensive and BAD !! The is the worst restaurant that I have been in Chandler area.	bad
I really want to write a longer review about this when I am not sick (home today), but I've already waited too long to put up a review for this new business.Recently my wife and I noticed this place while going for dim sum at C-Fu Gourmet, which is in the same strip mall. We noticed their lunch buffet was substantially larger than other Indian places, so we vowed to give it a try.Like I said, more detail later, but you have got to go try this place out. They have around 19 items on their lunch buffet for $6.99 all you can eat. Their weekend buffet boasts 27 items for only $9.99. The food was up in my top three favorites in Phoenix and the service was excellent. I talked a little with the owner and he told me that everything is made fresh everyday. Nothing is left over for the next day. The dishes changed daily. You really can't go wrong here--the cheapest, the best selection, and one of the best flavor-wise in the Valley. All things considered, this is my new favorite.	good
I had the lunch buffet a week after it opened, and it was really good.  The owner told me he was going to have a Friday and Saturday dinner buffet and I tried it tonight.  Outstanding!  The food was fresh and the chicken and goat dishes were very good.  But for me, the veggie daals, byranni, lentil soup and the Indian eggplant (don't remember the Indian name) was outstanding!!The owner told me he changes the buffet each day so the food is fresh.  At  $9.99 for a very large buffet on a Saturday nite, it was more than worth a visit.I'm going back for that mango daal, the tamarind rice, and the egg plant (whatever it's called).  In one word...OUTSTANDING!  It really was that good!	good
What most people don't realize about Indian food is that it changes from region to region. Most Indian restaurants in this country serve only Punjabi (northern food). Matka specializes in Hyderabadi food. The city of Hyderabad is known all over India for having the most flavorful food with influences from both south and north. I have not had authentic Hyderabadi food outside of Hyderabad until now. It's spicy and full of flavor. The signature dish is their Biryani. And the biryani at Matka is to die for. 100% authentic. They also have a a huge variety in their buffet with many delectable options to choose from. And dinner buffet on weekends. Food is fresh. You can taste the difference. Thank God for this restaurant. I have to eat here at least once a week out i start having withdrawals. Best Indian restaurant in the Valley hands down!	good
I have a good Indian restaurant that I like, but it is a bit far away and not very convenient with the evening traffic. I found Matka without any previous information (they have been here for a couple of months) and decided to try them because they are in such a convenient location (for me).I had a great buffet lunch.  Very nice naan, very nice papadums, very nice pakoras, stuff that will tell you how good a place is.  I will be back this week for dinner, for sure.	good
"You can change your name from Matka to Kamat to anything else but if you have to advertise that you are not ""recycling"" (which is re-serving one customers food to another that may have been untouched), and that all food is cooked daily, you have to seriouslywonder!Quality of the butter chicken was ok . The tandoori chicken was dry and old and they dont follow the online buffet menu: no kheer, only sooji ka halwa which in no way closely resembles a dessert. I rate this as : ""been there done that""Naan was burnt but masala dosa was a nice touch. They also some how ran out of yogurt and couldnt make a Lassi. Thats like a wing place running out of wing sauce.."	bad
I went to Matka for dinner and found that they have a buffet.  Food was below average to average.  First of all, the variety seemed rather limited, which is surprising for a buffet.  I'm not at all a vegetarian, but I usually look forward to Indian buffets for the vegetarian choices.  Not so here.  They do have the usual Aloo Gobi (cauliflower dish), Palak Paneer, and the pakoras.  The quality was ok, but nothing special.  As for the meat dishes, the butter chicken rather bland - shocking for butter chicken, I know.  Disappointing :(.  They also had a lamb curry (ok, but not as flavorful as most Indian lamb dishes should be), Chili chicken (actually pretty good!), Chicken vindaloo (average ) and a few other things that I can't remember since they were relatively nondescript.  The price was acceptable.  The decor was typical.  The service was pleasant enough.I think they just opened - in a way, this means that you can give them the benefit of the doubt.  I probably won't though, since I already know of other Indian restaurants that are better.	bad
"For a place that claims they don't reheat food, it's ironic because the buffet had the quintessential ""reheated Indian buffet food"" taste. Make no mistake, this is a South Indian restaurant through and through. They can say ""North Indian"" dishes on the menu but it tastes like South Indians cooking North Indian food. Sambar is in nearly everything and it tastes sour which can tell you where the chef is from. The place was hot and muggy inside. The place had an odor and it just felt really dirty in there. I won't be coming back"	bad
Matka is now Kamat... and it is all Veg restaurant now.. and the taste has been getting better and better with each of my visit. It opened as KAMAT recently and I was there shortly when it reopened... I was given a warm welcome by the Owner Lady, and we ordered some snacks.. Everything was delicious.... We had gone for lunch buffet on weekend... and Wow... It was like a royal lunch buffet.. with so many dishes spread out.. and taste.. ummmmmm... !!! At this rate I am sure this restaurant will very soon be the No.1 in the valley !!! Everything is wonderful including the people and service... Go try it today ...  :)	good
Fresh, tasty and very authentic! I am definitely going to be a regular here :)	good
We were shopping around the area when we noticed this restaurant and decided to go in for buffet lunch. The food was typical south Indian with not a lot of good options for Vegetarians. Me and wife tried out a few dishes - Paneer dish was sweet, the Bagaire Baigan (eggplant) was way too oily. Veggie food only saving grace was sambhar.I eat meat, so I tried out the chicken biryani which was average, other dishes were average too.My wife's pregnant so she takes a bit long to finish her food, the restaurant server apparently didn't like that, she was trying to hurry us even though they were open for another half hour and had only 25% tables occupied.	bad
Thought of trying this out for lunch buffet today..We eat out quite frequently but have never been to this one. Cons:a. The chef needs to know that Indian food needs salt . Food tastes like Indian hospital food if theresn't any salt.  I heard another person complain as well when I entered.. So am not alone.b. When this restaurant had a different owner , I thought I saw better ambiance inside.. Right now there is a mirror that is about it.. Just plain walls everywhere.. Booths did look very small and we didn't try it anyways. Interestingly , there was no music either ..c. Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water, spices, Dal and vegetables like onion. In here only the first ingredient was present.d. When we entered , the Naan tray was empty. When I tried twice later on, they were empty. When I left , they were empty. The owner or manager was right there. But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all. I left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan. My wife who was fortunate to get one piece said it was good.c. Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry. Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice.d. What is up with the vegetarian choices - egg plant curry and zucchini curry.. Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet?e. The served bottle water which was good but food should be good too which was absent.f. I thought the menu said vegetable biryani. I only saw colored rice. Didnt taste like Biryani.g. Food felt fresh as the website claimed . Only the chef needs to learn to cook better.h. I wouldnt go there for dinner . The owner needs to add some interiors to this restaurant otherwise it would compete only with the C-Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner.I would revisit to give them a fair chance at dinner this month.. But right now it is 1.5 stars..There are better Indian choices at the moment in the valley.	bad
Definitely good Indian food. Family came by and shared a few dishes. We had the Spring Vegetable Dosa for appetizer that was super yummy. For main course we split the Vegetable Biryani,  Chicken palak,  okra and tomatoes, and goat masala.  Everything was EXCELLENT and super TASTY! If you want good Indian food in Chandler come here!	good
In short, tasty food with a great flavor. The chicken biriyani is by far the best i have had in phoenix. I have been there for dinner (ordered a la carte') and the lunch buffet which had impressive spread. Also, they provide bottled water at no additional cost.	good
This has changed ownership and name and is now Kamat (an anagram of Matka, oddly) and is just getting started. This is the third Indian/Pakistani type restaurant in as many years in this location so I imagine it'll be tough going but they''ll have my business.I've been to Kamat twice now and the food is just lovely. Lunch is buffet of course but for an evening meal they emphasize thali    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thali    I had a chicken biryani thali that came with rice, daal, naan, kheer and more....this was a takeaway meal,  when I unpacked it and sampled everything, it made me weak in the knees....so good!  I can't wait to go again and try the goat curry.  It's a small operation so be patient with the staff or try the lunch buffet. I could have given 5 stars for the food but it's early days yet.  I hope they can last.	good
I have been to this restaurant to have dinner. I was told by one of my colleague that the food taste and options are great. But the quality and taste did not come close to what we were expecting. Seems like the food was recycled from the lunch buffet. The naans were hard like stone also the mutton biriyani tasted like eating uncooked rice. Frankly speaking I would myself cook much better then what I had experienced here. I would not recommend my friends or relative to have dinner here.	bad
Purchased tuna sub which tasted par for the course being from Subway. However, one of the two cookies with my combo had a hair baked into it. Unfortunately I did not notice until I had eaten half the cookie. Very disgusted and disappointed in this location.	bad
I like this Subway location.  It is always clean and the staff has been consistent for quite a long time.  They are quick in preparing the sandwiches and are somewhat patient when customers don't know what they want.  You may know my pet peeve, flies, I don't recall any problems while visiting this Subway.  I highly recommend this location for a health sandwich when you're in the neighborhood.	good
It's Subway, so you know what to expect. However, some Subways are better than others, and this is one of the better ones. It's always clean and the owner seems to be on the ball. And they always have those chocolate chip cookies ready (not the case for every Subway.)The only reason for the four stars opposed to five is the constant turnover for employees, which can make ordering slow at times because someone new is often being trained. Overall, if you're looking for a clean and reliable Subway, this location should be considered.	good
I know that this airport strives to be the friendliest.... Perhaps they need to share that philosophy with the people that work here. Thankfully they have Blue Moon.	bad
"We waited for 10 min at a table while all the servers wiped tables, chatted, etc. When I finally got eye contact with a server I got the ""damn can't you wait"" look. Finally we got menus thrown on the table, no hi, no nothing, while she was on her way to the next table. That table had been trying to flag her down to tell her there was something wrong with their food. It looked disgusting. That was enough for me. I guess at least I got a place to sit for 20 minutes undisturbed. Oh wait, this is an airport, I can sit anywhere. Damn, can I get my 20 minutes back?"	bad
The other review apparently was expecting a fine-dining experience. It's an airport bar that serves the kind of food you expect from a quick little bar near the gate. Not healthy, not hand prepared lovingly by a team of 5 star cooks. Quick bite to eat with a beer or cocktail before you pushback. It's perfect for that. Don't come here for your 25th wedding anniversary dinner.Recommend.	good
I guess the nice thing to say would be that they had beer and I didn't get food poisoning?The staff pretty much could care less if you're there or not - I don't think I've experienced a server that was that checked-out in a long time. My food was edible, but came on a plastic plate? For real?? Is there not a real kitchen back there? No dishwasher. Very ungreen. Much like the rest of Phoenix.If I didn't have a meal voucher from United and had to pay for what I consumed this would be a one-star. I'd rather eat Wendy's.	bad
Decent food, decent beer, fast service, what more do you want?  Price was fair too.  Some TVs to catch sports.	good
The pluses - they serve beer and have sport on screens at the bar; you'll be glad to get home.The minuses - food is nasty (think very bad school cafeteria); wait staff we had were pretty rude; it doesn't come cheap which is actually a blessing as you are less likely to order; and if you want quick this isn't the place.Asyou can see not the best of establishments.  I cannot see going back any time soon.	bad
"Reincarnated from ""Wok on Yonge"", this restaurant has very basic decor, and a huge menu of both Thai and Chinese dishes. My favourite dish is the cold spring rolls appetizer, and I often get the mango salad and Tom Yum (thai lemongrass) soup. I've found the Thai curries vary from tasty to meh, and the Pad Thai is just okay, in my opinion. On the Chinese side, I really liked  the Crispy Ginger Beef - it reminded me of Calgary Ginger Beef, which I sometimes miss! Definitely not the healthiest choice, though.Service also varies, though it's usually pretty good. More often, I get take-out. Prices seem average given the amount and quality of the food."	neutral
Phuket Paradise....what can I say about this place? Well...one thing is that it's definitely far from paradise..hahaha...It's a pretty basic place...looks like it's from the 90's. For the lack of Thai restaurants in Richmond Hill I have been to this place several times...sometimes to pick up take out and sometimes for lunch. Some dishes like their cold spring rolls are pretty awesome and the tom yum soup is good. However I'm not really crazy about anything else in that place. Their main dishes like Pad Thai and other noodles and rice dishes are just okay... too much sauce or weird sauce flavour....I ordered stir fry veggies and it was practically raw, the sauce they used was kinda gross, so I didn't even eat the dish. Bottom line...I don't think I will be back...unless I get an order of take out of their cold spring rolls...They are pretty awesome , like I have mentioned! ;) The service is fast and good...nothing special.	neutral
2.5 Star If I going to rate Phuket Paradise based on their Chicken Pad Thai, It would deserved a 1 star... Lunch Special from $6.99 with soup or spring roll. The selections are quite good with both Chinese and Thai fares... Maybe that is NOT a good sign? If a Thai restaurant serving chow mein..?? Both the Coconut Soup and Tom Yum Soup were really tasty, especially the Coconut soup which tasted good without being creamy. The Tom Yum is on the sour side, but my Yoga classmate seemed to enjoy that. Green Curry Chicken which suppose to be 3 chili spicy lack the spiciness, but I was surprised with all the veggie and the use of white meat in the dish. Pad Thai... stay away from Pad Thai.... the only thing is good about it is at least Phuket Paradise didn't use ketchup. But the Tamarind sauce they used tasted blend and the dish is kind of lukewarm not hot from the wok! Deco is nice but the whole restaurant smelled like bleach. But maybe I should feel assured that they scrubbed the floor really clean??!	bad
The possibility of puns shined bright in my head, but I restrained myself.Paradise, it ain't, but I went to Phuket, and I liked it.The place is very non-descript. It is clean, welcoming and bright. The menu is primarily Thai, but they also feature a large number of Chinese dishes.I had a Thai Coconut infused seafood soup. It came quickly, was nice and hot and had a nice balance of flavour. This is at the core of Thai food, that blend of tastes with the lemon grass assertively tweaking the mix.As an appetizer, we indulged in the cold rice paper rolls. The dip was very tasty, hut the rolls fell flat. They had an unexciting melange of vegetsbles with cellophane noodles, and not the usual shrimps. I regretted not listening to my wifenas she urged me not to order 2 serving of the appetizer.As mains we ordered a Green Curry with heef and a Seafood and chicken Pad Thai, with a bowl of steamed rice. The Pad Thai was authentic and good, with a good amount of tamarind to arrive at the right taste and colour. The Green Curry was delicious, with an ample serving of delicious and tender slices of beef. This was a 4 star dish.We drank Jasmine tea with our meal. Overall the food was good, the portions large and the vibe OK. At $52 before HST it was a bit pricey.This maybe due to the fact that we were charged for 2 teas.	neutral
Hard to find - food is just okay, but portions are gigantic. Considering that you can share one plate among two people, it's great value for the money. Restaurant is never busy, honestly don't know how they're still afloat, but I'm not complaining ... it's tranquil place to grab a bite most weeknights. They do take out too, but portion sizes are smaller.A long time ago - used to be home to Chopsticks, at the time, Thornhill's only legitimate Chinese restaurant.	neutral
Amazing value for afternoon lunch that can't be beat. Huge portions that include either a spring roll or a soup. Surprising the coconut chicken soup was really great and definitely made for a good appetizer. If your looking to get the best bang for your buck in thornhill, this place is it.	good
I come here for one thing and it's amazing every. single. time. The damn creamy curry.Usually if you get it with a meat it also comes with string beans.  I ask them to sub out the meat out for eggplant and it is just perfecttttt.  The curry is mild and is legit one of my favs in toronto. The portion size is also HUGE here. it'shard to finish the dinner portion on your own. I should note that the place is kind of grimey though, nothing fancy, but you won't care once you try the curry!	good
2.5 stars. It's very obvious that this place is Chinese run, given that they don't realize how funny their name can be, and that they have many Chinese dishes on their menu. Even their receipts have Chinese printings. That should raise some flags in your mind about how authentic this place is. But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.We ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out. They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding. I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.Red Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.Phad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots. Basil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.Tamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.Their prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise. I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp. But I wouldn't mind ordering a curry again.	bad
My favorites: coconut soup, green curry shrimp, ice tea latte thing they make, and mango salad.Big portions!	good
I like this place. The food is decent enough, service is not so bad considering it never gets that full (that fact should tell me something) The only reason I come here is because they have a chicken version of szechuan szechuan's crispy ginger beef which I really like. This has to be the only reason I visit.I've had several other dishes such as pad thai, mango salad, green curry beef and each one has been pretty average. Not great but not bad.Come to think of it, I'd give a 2 for most dishes	neutral
"I dined here with a group of friends for a Valentine's dinner. We ordered a steak, a prosciutto with melon platter, caprese salad, and a calamari. The calamari tasted phenomenal, as did the prosciutto. The steak was covered in gravy sauce, but the steak itself was not as good in flavor nor texture. ""Dinner for two"", which also included a soda, bottle of water, a tiramisu and cappuccino costed 72€, plus my voluntary tip. I probably wouldn't have tipped if I knew what was about to happen. (I always tip generously at restaurants, except when the waitstaff treats us cheaply.)We overall enjoyed our experience at the table as a group until the end when the waiter tried to charge one of the couples in our group for additional items which they did not order. It seems as if somebody else's meal had not been paid and our friends were being pressured to pay it. During the meal, we were pleased and everyone thought it was a good place for special dinners, but after the problem with the check, we all changed our minds. The waiter had the audacity to tell one of the ladies in our group that paying it would not make you poor. He's right, but we're also not stupid. What an insult. So from a 4.5 star experience, with the 1 star treatment in the end, they get a very generous 3-star. (Only a sincere apology from the owner to our group would change my rating to 4.)"	neutral
"Haben uns zu diesem Restaurant gegoogled und sind auf Grund der Bewertungen zu diesem Lokal gegangen. Bedienung war sehr langsam und nicht kompetent. Essen hat sehr lange gedauert, war gut angerichtet. Leider waren 2 Pizzen kalt und mussten nochmals in die Kueche. Bei einem Gericht waren die Teigtaschen zu ""a; dente"", hatte ich bisher auch noch nicht. Lasagne war geschmacklich gut aber sehr kleine Portion. In Summe war es sehr enttauschend und ich weiss nicht ob der Koch oder die ganze Mannschaft schon im Weihnachtsurlaub waren."	bad
My waiter was great!  The food was outstanding and they have Bitburger on tap. From the salad to the entree, this place has it together. I was visiting Patch and this place was recommended by a lady at the Marriott. On both nights I went the waiter, one was hot, gave me great service and no issues with my bill. They use the correct amount of arugula in their dishes, which is hard to do. Super! I'll be back when I come to Sindelfingen.	good
"Das Restaurant befindet sich direkt am Wasserturm in Goldberg, eine Bushaltestelle befindet sich direkt vor dem Haus. Die Karte ""schockiert"" vielleicht durch die etwas erhöhten Preise, aber diese sollte man gerne in Kauf nehmen, denn die Pizzas sind kaum zu übertreffen. Sie sehen schmackhaft aus, sind es natürlich auch und vor allem sind sie ordentlich groß. Jeder Wunsch wird berücksichtigt. Die Bedienungen sind sehr nett."	good
Gemeinsam mit meiner Begleitung waren wir schon einige Male im Ristorante La Romantica zum essen.Ich muss sagen, dass ist einer der leckersten italienischen Küchen im Umkreis Sindelfingen. Meistens wurden wir freundlich empfangen und es wurde uns ein Tisch zugewiesen. Mittlerweile haben wir unseren Stammplatz! :-)Letztens aß meine Begleitung ein Nudelgericht mit Steinpilzen und ich hatte mir eine Dorade gegönnt. Dazu gab es einen angenehm gekühlten Weißwein (Marani). Aber von vorn, nach Empfehlung des Kellners bestellten wir uns als Vorspeise jeweils einen Babyblattspinat Salat mit Früchtedressing. Bin zwar nicht so ein Salatfreund aber ich muss zugeben es war mal was anderes und ich werde es gerne wieder bestellen. Wie schon gesagt gab es als Hauptgericht ein Nudelgericht (frische Nudeln aus der hauseigenen Nudelproduktion) mit frischen Steinpilzen. Für mich gab es eine Dorade, es war außen kross gebraten und innen zart saftig, als Beilage gab es Bratkartoffeln in Weißweinsauce. Der Wein hat fantastisch zum Essen gepaßt, so konnten wir zur 2. Flasche nicht nein sagen.Im großen und ganzen ist das Essen und die Gastfreundschaft sehr zu empfehlen, die Einrichtung und das Ambiente sind nicht modern aber gemütlich. Wir werden gerne wiederkommen um auch die die anderen Köstlichkeiten der italienischen Küche zu probieren!	good
Amazing fresh cooked meal, homemade pasta, and a friendly environment where you are treated like an old friend. I spilled my sambuca and he instantly brought another.	good
"Das Restaurant liegt zu Füßen des Wasserturms auf dem Goldberg in Sindelfingen.Wir wurden sehr freundlich begrüßt und an unseren Tisch geführt. Der Gastraum ist zweigeteilt und es gibt eine große Terrasse. Der Gastraum ist wenig einladend, dafür war der Service umso besser. Lediglich die weißen Handschuhe beim Servieren waren dem allg. Niveau nicht angemessen. Eher Pizzeria als Gourmet Italiener. Die Pizzen die wir gesehen haben waren RIESIG!!! Die Speisen (Tomatensuppe, Antipasti, Pasta) waren sehr schön angerichtet und lecker. Der Vorspeisenteller war mir pers. zu ""wurst-lastig"" und zu wenig Selbstgemachtes.Die Pasta von der Tageskarte war sehr lecker."	good
Da habe ich meine Verlobung gefeiert. Es war ein unvergesslicher Tag, es war alles schon vorbereitet, der Tisch war stillvoll dekoriert und das Essen hat super geschmeckt. Ich gehe immer wieder gerne hin und ich kann es nur weiter empfehlen. Besuchen Sie La Romantica und sie werden sich selber überzeugen.	good
Thanks for your time to read this. I had walked in to a subway restaurant which is located in the south east corner of western and 401. Employes were just standing around talking to each other in there native language, didn't care about the costumers. One employ was coughing all over the station. No hair net. Talking to fellow employees and spitting all over food. Worst experience ever! Never going to a subway joint ever. ROBOshane	bad
This place is a godsend for guests at nearby hotels who would otherwise go hungry or live on room-temperature snacks for the duration of their stay. I was just involved in a conference at which many of the attendees might have perished in the Canada wind if it weren't for Subway. I had a veggie sandwich, which was delicious and life-affirming, considering the circumstances. Thanks, Subway!	good
Yes. 4 stars for a Subway. Why? First of all, it's in close proximity to the Toronto Airport hotels. Secondly, and probably the most important, it's 24 hours. This is huge for late night eaters who don't want to wander all over Toronto to get a meal.The place itself was really no different than any other Subway I've been to. The service was prompt, friendly and accurate. What more can you ask for in fast food? I was very satisfied. The Indian gentleman that crafted my sandwich added a certain ingredient that made the sandwich wonderful and unforgettable--yes my friends--LOVE.	good
I'm a big fan of Subway, but for this one I'll make an exception.  First visit was adequate service and average sub.  This morning was surly service and a not great sub as a bonus she put the wrong sauce on to go with stingy toppings.  There's lots of choices in the area including another Subway...no need for me to go back here.	bad
"I went there yesterday after buying a ""Now"" deal via Groupon. I got $20 groupon for $10. I went with three kids and found that the groupon is not worth buying UNLESS its just two people going. For example, the groupon is not valid for their ""kids eat for 99 cents with each paying adult"". Not to mention the food is over priced for the quality as well! Also, the have All-you-can-eat fish Fridays for roughly $10 but we couldn't get this because we had a groupon. The waitresses there are VERY rude. I told her I was waiting for the groupon to load and it would only be a second be cause we were not expecting to come and her response was ""so do you want a seat or what?"" the place was not that busy for her to be so rude...anyhow, I never complained and eventually after being sitted the waiters kept walking by like we didn't exist until the supervisor (I believed him to be) came over and took our order and he was nice. The environment and the way they treat their customers is rude over all and I've been there 3 times over the last 2 years. The fried pickles were barely battered this time so my kids didn't enjoy them as much.....Oh and don't ask the wrong person for help because they will tell you that they are not in charge of your table and will walk away."	bad
Val and Bill are the bomb! Great friendly service and fresh delicious food! Chorizo made on site!	good
"Visited today with two grandchildren, ages 2 and 7. Fries that came with children's menu mac 'n cheese were overdone, too brown & crunchy. Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first, but he wolfed it down eventually. My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm. This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold. The toast was so smeared with butter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it. Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too. He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns. They were delicious. Granddaughter liked her kids' menu French toast and ate most of it. My coffee was good, but I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar.Our waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes. She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again. We said yes again. She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly. The place was busy, so maybe she was overworked, but we ended up feeling rushed too. Our waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card. Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), ""We don't combine cards!"" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones. She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp. We never did get that second extra stamp, but by that time, we were done with her. We left a minimal tip.Today's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality. We go only if we have coupons. Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again. It simply doesn't impress me with its service or its food."	bad
"Garbage! This place was not ""Classic 50's style"" at all! The burgers were so dry and flavorless, I'm amazed people still would even go here, you might as well go to Carl's Jr, Wendy's, or Jack in the Box instead of this place! Don't waste your time or your money. If you want good classic 50's style restaurant go to Chase's Diner in Chandler waaay better!"	bad
Woohoo! This particular Five and Diner is as good as it gets for a Five and diner!!! The owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff. Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner. So.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please. The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere. The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.  I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc.. My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items. I believe kid menu items are 99 cents when an adult purchases an entree on M-F. If not M-F, I know for sure kids are 99 cents on Fridays.	good
I was not overly impressed.  Service was INCREDIBLY slow.  We were using a Groupon.  I would have been terribly upset without it.  Food was ok, but I think that was mostly because we were starving.  No apologies for lack of service.  No smile.  No return once food was served.  Won't be eating here again.  They automatically added 18% tip for party of 6, definitely not earned.  I normally tip minimum 20%, not here.  Not this day anyway.	bad
The decor is great. There are little jukeboxes at every table. The service is good. But the menu is a little too Denny's-like for my taste. There is a good selection of burgers and breakfast items, but nothing terribly unique or too reminisent of a 50's style diner. A bit pricey too. Overall I was pretty disappointed.	neutral
Smells like a public restroom in the diner. Avoid at all costs!!!	bad
When I visit Phoenix, this is the best place for burgers and fries.  They do some unique soda flavors.  I love their Vanilla-Cherry Coke.  Breakfast is good too, but I am not much of a breakfast person.	good
This place was awesome - Val our waitress was super nice and very helpful.  Place is a cool looking diner with a MASSIVE menu, was all most too hard to decide what to eat.  I had a reuben and the kids both had pancakes (mickey mouse shaped - so cute) - the best though was my husband's a double burger - I can't remember when we had anything so good, yes - I had to eat some of it!!	good
My husband and I recently went to 5 and Diner on a Sunday morning and we were impressed.  Not only is the decor cute and retro, we had fantastic service and our breakfasts were wonderful!  It was really a nice surprise.  We plan to go back again soon.	good
Great food and wonderful service. Here during breakfast hour. I will be back.	good
Whenever I am there, I always feel welcomed by the staff and I have never had a problem with service.  The food good and the atmosphere is fun.	good
Incredibly polite and efficient service.  Plus, no wait on a Sunday afternoon, which is the exact opposite of, say, IHOP.  We came for breakfast and were bowled away by how great the service was - the waiter had every possible configuration of questions on how we'd like out food, and even offered salsa as soon as the entrees came out.  I wasn't planning on salsa for my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs but sure, what the hell.  Well, the salsa was delicious with the perfect amount of kick - I ended up dousing my buttery hashbrowns in it and going to town.  Eggs and chicken fried steak were both tasty and the toast was thick cut and good to sop up the extra gravy.  My husband had an omlette which he seemed to enjoy, though the portion looked just a tad small.  Truly a yummy 3-star meal, though the great service just bumped things up even more.  They were just SO nice and so insistent that we come back, I'm wondering if the location (in the Arizona Mills parking lot) is making the business struggle a bit.  I hope not, because I definitely will return.	good
"Salads are very iceberg-heavy.  Not bad, just old-fashioned.  Nothing remarkable.  My daughter commented that the lettuce tasted almost frozen.Chicken Pot Pie ( ""NEW"" ) is not much more in quantity than the $3.50 frozen Swanson version you can cook at home.  Nothing remarkable here either.French fries were hot and crunchy and good.  Best part of the meal.Worst part:  The AWFUL chicken strips.  You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick, heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion?  Yep, they use those.  There is a layer of impossibly hard and tasteless breading on the outside, then a little thin moist layer of unfried breading under that, and then in the small remaining center a smidgen of real chicken.  NEGATIVE 500 STARS on the gross chicken strips.I only went there because I had a BOGO entree' coupon.  Not worth it at all.P.S.  I have eaten here several times (mostly because of coupons) and they all fell below 3 stars."	bad
"My wife and I needed a place to grab some lunchtime breakfast food over the weekend, and seeing as how we couldn't find anything better, we stopped by 5 and Diner. I've never been overly impressed with 5 and Diner in the past, and I have to say, they met my mediocre expectations this round as well. My wife ordered the pancake sandwich with two eggs and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with raisin toast. None of which was better than what you can make at home, but it wasn't disappointing either.Overall, the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills. However, here's where the problem comes in. When my wife ordered the pancake sandwich the server asked my wife ""do you like bacon or sausage"", to which she replied ""bacon"". Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said ""the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra"". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on. The food was decent, but I have a big problem with dishonest servers and that's what knocks this place down from being a decent breakfast joint to just another bump on the road of mediocre cuisine."	bad
OK: what happened?Several of us stopped by this 5 & Diner location (Arizona Mills) around 7 PM today (11-10-2012) and they are CLOSED!There was a handwritten sign on the front door stating in essence 'we're closed and thanks for the memories'. I'm guessing Val threw in the towel. :(I'd give this store 4 stars since I've eaten here in the past but the sudden and unannounced closure earned it a single one.	bad
Food was decent, they were extremely busy though, on a Saturday afternoon and didn't seem to have enough staff. Portions seemed pretty hearty, but I think I'd probably enjoy more during non-peak hours-the place was kind of a zoo, and all the staff seemed a little confused.	neutral
Nothing special here.  This time I just went for dessert and ordered an Oreo shake.  It's kind of hard to mess that up so I can't complain.  It is a large shake though I'll say that.  Service was fine, and it definitely has the 50s diner atmosphere.  They even have mini juke boxes at each table and you can pick a song for a quarter I think.Tip: If you are looking for a late eat besides the 24-hour Mexican joint, this may work.  Open until 10 Sun-Thu, and until 11:30 Fri-Sat.  Or, the one on 16th St in Phoenix is open 24 hrs.	neutral
I have been to other 5 & DIner restaurants and enjoyed my meal, especially the one at the Scottsdale Pavillions. However, I have now had two disappointing meals at the diner at the Arizona MIlls in Tempe. Today's lunch was a terrible affair.We arrived at about 12:30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied. What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but. It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and then a very long time for our meal.I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer.My burger was beyond well done, and dry, but greasy from the cheese and sauces. Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce. I was hungry and waited too long to bother sending it back. I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries.M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy! So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right.Overall I'm extremely disappointed by this location. I now understand why there were so few people eating there as well.	bad
5 stars just for the shakes! They have really great chocolate shakes, so good we went back a second time just for them.The breakfast was also good. Classic diner style, with big portions. Only disappointment was the biscuits - tasted a little rubbery and right out of the microwave, otherwise a solid place for a meal.	good
We love the feel and the food of a genuine 50's diner. My wife and I went to this one last night. It was just okay. Not even quite okay but just BLAH. I ordered the sliders. Here's my opinion folks for what it is worth: Whenever I have ordered sliders ANYWHERE in the country the sliders have always come THREE to an order. This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate. The fries were good don't get me wrong. The sliders were okay. There was only meat and cheese on them. The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions. Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them. Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt. It wasn't malty. It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt. Service was just okay. We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there. Biggest complaint: It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C. They turned on the ceiling fans without the A/C and we were still uncomfortable but it was somewhat bearable. I would strongly recommend that if you want the look and feel of a genuine 50's diner with food and service to match that you go elsewhere.	bad
Breakfast. Go for Breakfast! -choose one of the innocuous seeming egg and potatoes breakfasts, w/ biscuits and a side order of gravy.  It's $6.75, and you may think it will all fit on one plate. However, you'll quickly note that there's twice as many hash-browns as anywhere else, and the food is incredibly fresh. Everything home-style. There's no way you'll finish it or find a place that tops....service and coffee is great too.	good
I've been here a LOT. I live down the road. To start...the food here is pretty much all good. The only thing I would suggest avoiding is the nachos. They load them up but so much the chips turn soggy real quick. However they have odd things like deep fried pickles which are delicious and their breakfast foods are super delicious.The staff is wonderful and we are never left for wanting to say the least. Some of them actually recognize us by face which is nice. The restaurant itself is really nice, some of the seats are a bit beat up but otherwise it's always really clean and they have mini juke boxes at each table and you get 2 songs for a quarter so bring your change! Unless you hate 50s music that is. It's also all 50 decor inside so if you're looking for a nostalgic place, this is the place to go.As for the shakes, everyone is right in saying they are awesome and they're HUGE. I can almost never finish them. Over all, I'd highly suggest this place and also you can ask for the discount cards so if you get 7 meals, you get 1 free. It's not very pricey either which is a plus.	good
This is one of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots in the Valley, and I am surprised by many of the negative reviews it has received. They serve great breakfast burritos and pancakes, and a wide variety of omelets. Their coffee is good enough. For lunch, they offer a wide variety of excellent sandwiches. Here's a useful bit of information for my fellow Chicagoans: 5 & Diner serves Vienna pure beef hot dogs. My personal lunch favorite, my main reason for giving them five stars, is their veggie burger, which I order with green chile, no cheese, and a side of french fries. Be sure to ask for the Cholula hot sauce. This is a great casual dining spot with a classic diner motif and golden oldies playing regularly to accompany your meal. This location, set outside of Tempe's Arizona Mills, is my favorite location.	good
This place is open earlier than other breakfast spots in the area. The food is standard, nothing amazing. The atmosphere is fun and the music gets you going. The service is S L O W! It was like pulling teeth to have our server talk to us. We asked for the bill after we ordered to expedite the process, but that never happened. I couldn't believe how this guy drug his feet. He payed a lot of attention to the people ordering off the senior menu, I guess he thought the old folks would tip better?? Anywho...it's a good standby but definitely not a destination...	bad
My boyfriend and I stopped in to 5 & Diner after he picked me up at the airport and I was starving for some breakfast. They had all your diner favorites and it looked like they served the entire menu, even at 10 AM. I forgot the exact name of my dish, but it was bacon and eggs with biscuits and gravy. MMMM all of my favorite foods on a plate. The bf had the same, but with a chocolate milkshake! I hate boys and their fast metabolisms. The biscuits were nice and fluffy, but the bacon could have been a bit crispier.It's a nice Denny's/IHOP alternative. Good, quick service, but it was fairly empty at 10 AM on a Wednesday.	neutral
"Went here for dinner using a Groupon. We were sat right away and drinks came soon after. Then we waited. And waited. Several employees walked by, each time seeming to look the other way. As if to say,""You're not my table"".Finally a guy came over (may have been the manager) and said,""what can I get you?"" That's it. No ""Hi"" or ""are you ready to order?"". I was a little turned off at that point. I would've left since I was already annoyed at how long we were ignored for (I've done that before, you can tell when you're about to get crappy service) but the kids were ""starving"".Anywho, my patty melt was ok. I've had better. Fries were pretty good.Service continued to suck. Needless to say I won't be back. My family likes to eat out as a treat once/twice a week. When we find a place that has great food AND great service, we come back. That's where I'll spend my hard earned money. Not at 5 & Diner."	bad
Came here this morning  because I had a meeting in the area so I stopped in for some breakfast.  I have not been to a 5 & Diner since my single days of stopping in at 1am....back when bars closed at 1am.  Anyway, I order the breakfast special for $4.99 which is basically bacon and eggs and it was great, the hash browns were brown and crispy, eggs cooked perfect, bacon crispy, and the toast was like what I used to eat when i was a kid...the small bread.  Yep, i was pleased and the service was fantastic.  The atmosphere and decor is very casual and its 50's style with the music and all.  I am not a fan of Mill's mall but this place worked out nice this morning.	good
My boyfriend and I are super broke right now, so we're taking advantage of our Groupon credits.  We were hungry, and 5 & Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.  As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well.  As a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about.	good
Food was delicious, every item we had was fantastic. Took a while for the food to get to our table, and when it was busy we didn't see our server for about 25 minutes but it didn't ruin the experience. Overall I would recommend this place.	good
First time here. Decided to eat with friends after watching Harry Potter.  Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up. It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.Stepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.Despite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.So if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after. Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation.	neutral
Ambiance- This place is very nice, warm and cozy. The place is dimly lit which I  am personally comfortable with. The bar area is nice and the tables are spaced evenly throughout the restaurant. Food- I came here the night before Easter Sunday. So, I was not able to try any of the meat dishes.  The food is a bit disappointing. After you have the tapas at Firefly, it is difficult  to match the quality, quantity and taste of the food. Location-The location is great. Across from Blue Martini and steps away from the movie theaters. Town square is a great location. Price- A bit on the steep side. You do not get enough bang for your buck. You cannot really expect much because of the expensive rent  these places have to pay at Town Square. Service - It is OK, nothing special. Overall- I am a bit disappointed. Maybe it is because of the Five Star ratings that this place received. I expected a lot.	bad
Love this place!  Great food and friendly people! Wasn't as good the second time	neutral
"I went for happy hour (5-7pm) on a Sunday Night. The sugarcane sangria is delicious($5 on happy hour). The original Mojito on the other hand was not! I had the habanero pepper jack and cheese, it was VERY SMALL and tasted not too much different than Kraft Mac&Cheese. I heard a lot about ""TRUFFLE CHIPS"" but all I could taste was the truffle oil. The ceviche was okay but overpriced. Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and the patio is great as it looks over townsquare park. I would possibly go back for sangria but nothing else... Definitely not a place to enjoy a nice meal or even some appetizers with a drink."	bad
"A nice location sandwiched between Bar Louie and Blue Martini at Town Square. I have to say that this should be ""the"" spot of the summer (for drinks). It has a central location, Miami-ish décor, balcony that overlooks the Town Square park, and two additional balconies on both sides that are all perfect for people watching. Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot. However, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand. What was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.The sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly. As a matter of fact we ordered about ten different items on the menu and maybe the only thing that stood out was the mushroom ceviche and the dates with bacon (even though Firefly's is better but how do you mess up something with bacon wrapped around it anyway). Everything else was ... eh and will not have me running back there to eat. With places that have waaaaayyyy better food within walking distance (Johhny McGuire's, Yardhouse, Bar Louie, and even Cadillac Ranch) I'd rather eat somewhere else and afterwards go grab a couple drinks at night here."	neutral
I love Cana's mojitos which are muddled with fresh fruit and real sugar cane. I've also tried the caparinha which is also really good. Every time my friends and I come here, we either get the empanadas, beef tenderloin, slider dogs, classico ceviche, tuna ceviche, or the fish tacos.Happy Hour prices are amazing. You can eat pretty well for fairly cheap. The service has ALWAYS been excellent here.	good
My review is a little late coming but I really enjoyed Happy Hour when I was in Las Vegas for the final days of my campaign.  My work colleague and i decided to try Cana because of the 1/2 off mojitos.  I probably could have drank like 10 of them.  I tried the strawberry, original, cucumber mojitos.  DELICIOUS!  I had two strawberry.The small plates were also delectable.  Each had their own personality.  And we even ordered the churros for desert.  The waitress was awesome and one of the chefs even dropped by.  If I ever go back to vegas, I will definitely hit it up again.	good
I'm surprised this place is getting such great ratings. They market themselves as a ceviche place, and the ceviche is terrible. This was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time. When my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food. The first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab. Finally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent. I was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it. I would hate for them to suffer through this meal. It was awful. Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor. I will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely. Wouldn't be bad to stop in for a beer before or after a movie. I just wouldn't eat. Not sure this place will stay open long, it was pretty empty when we went, and, in the words of the hostess, reservations aren't really needed.	bad
"A friend and I went to dinner here, and while the experience was brief, and the conversation was enjoyable and longer than the meal, I had a good time.I didn't try much of their menu, save for their beef empenadas.  I found them to be tasty and well cooked.  Since I stuck with that, the pricing was respectable.  I had also tried their ""Fire Water"" drink based off the name alone, and I found it to be enjoyable as well.  A bit of a small glass, but the flavor was good.I don't want to rate it any higher on the grounds that I only had one menu and drink selection, and they were more of a quick snack than a full meal, but my friend and I enjoyed our individual meal selections, and the overall vibe and view were pleasant.Perhaps in returning at a later time, I'd be able to make a more concrete decision on where I want to place my enjoyment factor, but the first impression was pleasant enough to want to check it out again."	good
"It was my first time trying ceviche so, it could be like Beatles, Sgt Peppers being your first album.  But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your ""foodie"" DNA. This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said ""I wish I could try 5 plates"".  Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.If you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?) - Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi/fish ""cooked"" in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?) Shrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop. Short ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender. Piggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have. - Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people. ""Not as sweet"" as most. Lastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult. I want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square. Gun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason. I think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend, ""I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had"" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it. I was asking locals at the malls if they had been. I'll wait for Cana NYC to open up."	good
3.5 stars.  Both my wife and I wanted a small dinner and this was a perfect place to do it.  Went with the hirame ceviche which was was done w/ lavender, lychee and lime.  Interesting mix for a ceviche and tasty but I just prefer the regular stuff.  We also ordered the beef empanadas and the cuban sliders which were both very good.  While the menu was fine, my wife kinda wished there was a larger selection of stuff but it wasn't that big a deal.  Atmosphere is awesome.  Great place for drinks and this place is gonna rock when the weather gets warmer.	good
Really wanted this to be a great place.Sure looks good inside & I have to say the service was great. However I found the food way over priced and the portions small (Yeah I know Tapas are small plates) but from $12-$14 give me some meat. Drinks were tasty & I enjoyed the white sangria over the red but again pricey. Nothing really blew my top which is sad and I don't think I will be back I'm sorry to say. Lower your price or increase the portion size. I'm not cheap by any means.	bad
We stopped in on a Saturday night after seeing the sign.  We were going to grab some sushi but hadn't noticed Caña before and wanted to try it seeing as we're fans of tapas.Lots of small plates meant to be shared.  We ordered a salad, meatballs, hamachi ceviche, crab ceviche, churros, Cuban sliders, ahi tuna flatbread, and several drinks.Drinks were great.  Food was excellent.  However, the ceviche isn't really ceviche if that's what you're looking for.  The hamachi was sliced sashimi style with an delicious dressing.  Crab was more like a crab salad and had a metallic taste as if it were canned.  The crab ceviche was the only dish that wasn't excellent.Service is good.  Definitely a good place for groups.  It's rather noisy so be warned.  Can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can try the outside patios.	good
Went here on a Friday night- very nice vibe, sangria and mojito were yummy (should've listened to our waitress and got a pitcher for $28 since we ended up ordering that much in drinks anyways!)We liked the decor and feel of the restaurant- made us kinda feel like we were back home in SF at the XYZ Bar at the W Hotel.  We ordered beef tenderloin, lamb chops, mac n cheese and halibut ceviche.The beef tenderloin was good, portion was fine for the two of us.  The mac n cheese was REALLY good.  The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and great flavor.  The ceviche was fresh and came with a shot glass of sauce that you can put the halibut in or on.Overall, service was good we would come back for happy hour next time since we ended up spending a little over $100 for two...	good
Happy Hour:Daily 5-7PM, 12-2am26 items $5 or less (food and drink)The Peach Sangria was great, my girflriend immediately tried to recreate it at home.There are many different type of ceviche here, which are a bit different than ceviche I've had in the past (closer to sashimi), but really good.  I think I had the Miso one.In my previous review I had mentioned that they good, but a bit too expensive. I also suggested that they needed a happy hour.  Well, the owner messaged me on here to let me know that they have one now, with 26 items $5 or less.  With $5 plates, it definitely puts it into my price range, and I plan on coming back.	good
Grand opening tonight. Cute place and the food was terrific!	good
6 of us came out here tonight, a Monday night for happy hour, and we were happy.  We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.These are the tapas we ordered:-Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.-Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.-Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.-Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.-Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.Sopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.  Sugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.  Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...So, happy hour is definitely the time to go to try out many different tapas and drink the sugarcane sangria.  I will come back!	good
went to cana for happy hour and they had some really good specials, $5 mojitos and beers. the mojito was EXCELLENT. we also got the mac-n-cheese with habanero seasoning, nice size portion, and it was very good. the ceviche was really good also but small portions for the price, we got the trio ceviche spicy tuna (great taste), scallop (with mango and pomegranate seeds), and the mixit (shrimp & octopus) they were each like 2 - 3 bites and it was like $30 bucks, not worth it for the price!!!if you like sangria they have a special sugar sangria that is SPECTACULAR!!!!!! will definitely go back. also a mix crowd, all ages and groups will feel at home!!	good
Last night was my second time trying Cana, and quite frankly its not worth the money. My boyfriend and I got a pitcher of mojiots, empanadas, and a sorry excuse for a flatbread which was basically three slices of pita bread with a little smudge of melted cheese in the center... no sauce, no flavor. This cost us $75 after tip. We left still starving after a day of laying by the pool in the sun, and grumpy for wasting money. The only reason I gave two stars as opposed to one, is because I saw the bartender totally hook it up in our pitcher of mojito. He probably used half the bacardi bottle on us. But, needless to say, we met up with friends right after this, and immediately walked over to Brio for some hearty pasta, breads, and salads. Seriously, go to Firefly if you want tapas, this place is only good for drinks.	bad
Nice, vibrant environment.  The server was very friendly in telling us what we should try and most were accurate. Everyone raves about the pork sliders, but we found them to be very dry...needed a little more mustard or BBQ sauce in my opinion (cough cough...another drink please!). Maybe that was their intent...Drinks were great as she made sure we never ran dry.  Only bizzare area was going to the bathrooms.  There was a 16 year old texting on his phone when I entered the omni-sexual configured bathroom.  Felt strange, like he was supposed to be my wiper. Bizzare.Overall, great place!	neutral
This spot is not right down in the Strip... My guess it will be more locals, and shoppers as the restaurant is located in the very nice Town Square (http://www.townsquarelasvegas.com/)About the Restaurant:Mojitos... Great.Tapa style plates.... Great. I tried: The Ceviche: Lychee/lime/lavenderThe flatbread pizza: Grilled Chicken/mango/cilantro/queso blancoThe Mac & Cheese: with Habaner jace (my favorite)The Lamb Chops: with mint chimichurri (okay, also my favorite)Tried two of the three desserts: Bread Pudding with banana/rum sauce and the Chocolate Kiss, with Chipolte Foam... was not a fan of the foam...Service was outstanding, this was the second night they were open... so i hope they keep this up. Very friendly. Atmosphere was nice/modern/chic, I could use a brighter candle on the table... i had to use my iphone for light to read the menu... but they noticed right away, and said they would be working on it.	good
I'm not sure if I'd give this place 4 stars or 3 stars. I really wish we could do 1/2 stars. Went here for DINNER last night with some friends. Ambiance: low lighting, dark woods, modern feel, one big open room with tables plus outdoor patio seating which looked like it would be a great way to go in the Fall and Spring... they had cool (I thought they were cool) paper-like, scrunched lanterns hanging from the ceiling Menu: 2-page menu.... 1-page for drinks and 1-page for food What's cool is that they keep it simple but it's not a far reaching menu like some other tapas places I've been to... and if you're vegetarian this is NOT the place for you... I think there were 2 items on the menu that did not have meat or were meat based Downside: (and this is why I'd give them 3 stars) they were out of a number of items - out of all but 2 wines - out of 2 of the 8 beers - out of the short rib tacos and some other dish that I can't remember Taste: Excellent... everything we ordered was very tasty and well executed with a flair for presentation. Note: the portions are not super big.... so each plate is good for 2 people... we often ordered multiples. Enjoyed the Tuna Ceviche... Chicken Empanadas (now these were on the big side).... Chicken Tacos... Fish Tacos... Crispy Shrimp Dessert: WOW! If you like bread pudding... or even if you are just mildly interested.... try their Banana Bread Pudding.... YUM! It doesn't look like much when it comes out... but then you take a bite. Oh MY! :) We also ordered the Churros which were more like Cinnamon twists.. nevertheless... very good as well and I dipped the churros in the sauce the BBP came in... oh Yea! Service: Our waiter was cool.... super busy as it seemed like he was only 1 of 2 guys taking care of all the tables and it was a pretty busy night... almost all the tables were filled plus a big party of 10 The hostess was ... I guess... I'd say indifferent... she wasn't mean but she wasn't friendly either so.... Drinks: I ordered the raspberry mojito... and to me ... it was way too sweet... I personally think it needed more rum and less sugarcane but that's me. Plus they muddled the heck out of it so that there weren't pieces of fruit swimming around as I had expected... I like the chunks of fruit in my muddled mojito... I know... I'm strange. The white sangria however was FABULOUS... it too was sweet but in a different way. I know... that doesn't make sense... so let's just say this drink would be perfect for sitting by the pool .... refreshing and delightful. All in all... we'll go back... it's different from the norm and I want to try their Red Sangria.	good
My first time going to this place.I was very excited since i was recommended by a friend. here is the honest truth. I hope the restaurant owner reads this. Ok the service at the bar Not so attentive for patron rather they are more interested in what is happening in their lives, second the food it was ok the best is the empenada, THE WORST is the MEAT BAllS please owners read this remove it and fire your cook.third the  rib is good but it tasted like it was boiled in BBQ sauce for 20hrs, bcuz melted in your mouth, not so great. LASTly very pretensious	neutral
The hamachi ceviche is my favorite. The dates with goat cheese mousse were awesome too, along with the sangria. Wow. Best sangria I have ever had. We asked for the dates sans bacon and they were delicious--crisp and perfectly baked. Much better than Firefly where the dates are served soaking in a bowl of bacon grease (although I have to admit that Firefly introduced me to this dish so I shoudln't complain).The best part about my experience was the service. John is an amazing bar tender. All of the bartenders are very friendly and focused on the customer. They were genuinely interested in whether or not we liked our food and drinks. John introduced us to Cory, the owner, who is also a friendly, genuine person.  I don't think you'll find better service anywhere in Vegas, really. I have been going to Firefly for years and have never left feeling like the employees knew me or cared about my return. It's the opposite at Cana.I can't wait to go here when the weather gets nice too--large windows open up to the bar--it's a great indoor/outdoor space. Even though it was rainy and cold this Saturday, it was a fun place to be.	good
overpriced tapas.  Compared to Firefly they can't hold a candle to it.The only redeeming food they have is the mushroom ceviche. That was delicious but, so itty bitty for $8.If the happy hour is cheap I'll go check it out and give them a star if it's a good deal.Remember, we are in a recession.	neutral
We hit this place really late, sometime after 11PM.  Prior to that, we were at the Blue Martini, so this place was a real nice break from speakers that 'go to eleven'...Not a lot of people here but it's only been open a few weeks; hopefully that changes.  The bartender's were great!  Awesome mojitos and really great food.We had the chicken skewers, meatballs and churros.  Everything was really flavorful and unique.  The bartenders were extremely nice and friendly.  I wish I remembered her name but she was gorgeous!A really nice break from the usual 'Strip' stuff.	good
Since we had time to kill before a flick we decided to eat here.  After all, tapas is a nice way to eat lots without feeling like a pig.  We ordered a plethora of dishes, and I have to say that this place is pretty good, but not great.  The only thing I really loved were their short rib tacos, but the meat was overpowered by some serious guava jelly.  if they just held back a bit on the jelly, that dish would bump my review up to a 4 star.  I did break a glass on my way out, but they were nice about it.  I can't say much about this place because the dishes were pretty but not memorable, with the exception of their short rib taco.  Would I go back?  Maybe.  I'll give it 6 months.	neutral
Recently got to try this place out. I always end up comparing Tapas restraunts to Firefly because Firefly is so good and I love going there. For example, when I went to Johnny Smalls in the Hard Rock it was a huge dissapointment. So much more expensive and not half as good as Firefly. SO when I sat down at Cana I thougt I would end up dissapointed again..it was the complete opposite of a let down. I loooved this place and it was not as annoyingly busy and loud as Firefly. We got spicy tune ceviche..amazing especially with the chip thingys they bring out with it, beef emenadas..the crust is super flaky and yummy, mac n cheese..SO good and surprisingly spicy, and the meatballs. Oh, and of course, a pitcher of Sangria..the red one. Our waiter even gave us a sample of the white sangria which was also good but we were all more into the red. I can't wait to go back here and try some more things on their menu!	good
This review is not about the food but about the hosts. We went in for an early dinner. As we arrived, we are told by the hostess that we cannot be seated inside since the place was booked by a very large group. I asked if there was a comfortable area outside since I was still cold from seating outside in the shade on a very windy day at Blue Martini. We're told not to worry since we'd be sheltered from the wind. We get outside and we asked to sit at the only table located in the sun. As we are looking at the menu and finally warm up, the hostess comes back to our table and asked us to move to another table in the shade since apparently, the table in the sun is going to be used by the big party. Which by the way, we have yet seen. We decided to leave. Very unhappy. We ended up going to Nu right downstairs and were seated on the patio right next to a very pretty and warm fire pit.	bad
"Just received a nice message from Cana management:""I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you for taking the time to write a review of my restaurant, Caña.  I really appreciate it and I hope to see you in Caña again soon.  Please introduce yourself so I may say hi.Regards,Cory""I replied that there were some request for new / additional drinks...    Since Cana uses Rum and Sugar Cane in the majority of their drinks,     why not add some Polynesian drinks? A Mai-Tai made with Sugar     Cane as sweetener would sound deliciouso right about now!    One of the best Iced Teas I've ever had was at a restaurant in     Sacramento where the Iced Tea (not the Long Island kind) was made    with Sugar Caner.  Man... that sounds good in the Summertime in     Vegas!"	good
Great sangria, and the sliders are tasty!!Good place to hang out, just a little pricey. Hit it up at happy hour.	good
I recently revisited Cana and I'm glad I gave them a second chance.  I was very impressed with the waiter and the owner who were so welcoming and impressive with telling of what they enjoyed and the care that went into food preparation.I had far more food that I normally do but was glad I tried out so many things.  I'll list it out since my eyes were very hungry that night.:Hamachi - fresh and zestyDuck Empanada - delicious unique butter crust and sweet to biteMac N Cheese - so bad for you but so good when it hits your lipsCalamari - crispy and peppery and using the dipping sauce really adds to the flavorPork Chops - Loved the marinade, tender, and full of flavorBread Pudding - This hit all my senses as soon as it hit the table and really lived up to expectationsChurros - Best churro I've ever had, arrived warm and hot and the glaze just really made the flavor jump in you mouth.My friend had the white wine sangria and was very satisfied which is quite the compliment since she's very discerning.  I had a faux-jito, which was equally flavorful and fun.  Overall it was a great experience, nice ambiance, great service, and a welcome spot for friends, dates, and even business dinners.	good
Cana has some tasty food, but it is expensive.  Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):Beef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half.Mac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people.Cuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price.Crispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share.Chicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night.Sangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.During my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.  Cana's food is good from what I've tasted so far, but the prices are scaring me off from trying the other items, no matter how good they look.	neutral
The mojitos here are delicious... I love the original and the cucumber version.  The food is decent.  I've tried the mac-n-cheese (a bit spicy, but yummy), the flatbread (kinda bland, nothing special), the bacon wrapped dates (yummy, but you can only eat a couple before they are just too sweet), and the papas (very tasty).  My only complaint is that the place has been pretty dead every time I've been there... sure I don't like super crowded places, but I would literally be the only one talking in this place at times when the other 5 groups of people that were there would collectively have a lull in their conversations.  I don't know if people just haven't heard of this place or what.  The mojitos will keep me coming back, and hopefully a following will build for this place so it's a little more lively in the future.	good
Oh, Cana...how I LOVE thee...I'm telling you, every thing about this place is amazing.  Not only the food is delicious, the drinks are unique and yummy, the decor is modern and comfortable, and the staff is very helpful when it comes to explaining the menu and giving suggestions.I was introduced to this place in November 2010 and have been there 6 times.  This says a lot, because my boyfriend and I eat out often and it's hard to find a place that makes me want to come back time after time.  Cana's tapas are ALL delicious.  Beef empanadas, halibut, tuna ceviche, tacos, CHURROS!!  Oh my goodness, I need to go there for dinner!  LOL!Anyways, their drinks are also amazing.  Fresh sugarcane...lime...DELICIOUS and consistently good every time!!Cana truly is a gem!  Go!  Now...do it.	good
Awesome Food, great prices, and best service in town.  Truly they make you feel very special dining there.   All drinks made fresh, try the mojitos  :)  To top it off have a chocolate kiss or a churro, they are outstanding :)  Located in Town Square.	good
"Waitress was talking with some people at the other side of the bar. After 5-7 min waiting she came, put the menu in front of me and ask, with that very well known impersonal smile, ""what do you like to start"", ... I ask about Mojito, Seviche classic, ...and if there was any possibilities to turn the TV to sports, like soccer...(Consider the situation: World Cup; Brazil-Coast of Ivory game; only two girls and a guy at the bar talking on my left side and just me, in front of that TV, watching ""Jeopardy...."") The waitress told me: I don't like soccer, I don't watch it, so, I don't know where they broadcast the game"".  I just start  seeping my Mojito and forgot about the game. Minutes later came the seviche (tiny and good), and a second Mojito. Just before I finish, another couple arrives and ask about Brazil vs. Coast of Ivory's game, and then, just after 20-30 min after my first request, the bartender ask one of the guys working in the kitchen how to find the soccer game on ""...that TV""Funny end: the TV audio was OFF=MUTE=SILENT (natural, in a bar environments, right?) and the waitress was swapping channels, back and forward, until I said, ""STOP...there is...that one..."" (It was the Hispanic channel of Univision), and then,  she said the most interesting part of her appearance that night: ""Oh, that's why couldn't find it, it is in Spanish and I don't understand that language! """	bad
"I'm a sucker for tapas (or bocadillos in this case -- although I used to think bocadillos were sandwiches, which shows you how much I know, but I digress...). So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.First of all, there are 2 entries for Caña on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.Now for the review... Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the ""behind the bar"" area before getting to the dining area. With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.As for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even ""really good"" either.- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Caña might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up."	neutral
Good dating place. Good tapas place. Portion of foods are very small but they are very taste =DDefinitely good place for small biters!!!! Atmosphere was great and their churus was absolutely the BEST!!!!	good
My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new this weekend so we went to Caña. We've lived in Vegas for a year and this was the worst food for the price we've had so far. We ordered the scallop ceviche, chicken flat bread, bacon wrapped dates, salad, and meatballs. The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture. The chicken flat bread was sparse. The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream). The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked. I also ordered a glass of wine and it looked like it was two ounces. Our meal ended up being $74 and we were beyond disappointed. Cana should change it's layout into a lounge instead of a restaurant because it's more about the ambiance and view. The service was excellent and we tipped her accordingly but we will never go back.	bad
"I really, really, really wanted Cana's to be amazing and give me a new place to go for tapas...Fail.I went with a friend and sat at the bar to eat. We had to get the bartender's attention after being seated for about 5 mins, he was busy chatting with a friend at the other end of the bar. We ordered cocktails and our food, we ordered their Meatballs, Spring Rolls, Mac & Cheese, and the Dates. We ordered these because they're are favorites from Firefly so we could compare. And we thusly found out there was no comparison. Cana's offerings were ok, but nothing outstanding. The food really felt like someone was reading receipts out of a cookbook and attempting to add their own ""flair"". And along with the mediocre food was the mediocre bartender, he literally left us with empty glasses for 10mins until we could get ahold of his bar back and had him actually make us drinks. Firefly is still the king of Tapas Eateries in Las Vegas for me, Cana's was a disappointment."	bad
So, this was like our 10th time going to Cana (in what I thought was 6 months but is really 2) and I have to say I have not been disappointed yet.  The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful..each and every time!  The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio.  They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room.  Perfect!This visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu. (Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie...new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried but let's just say one of them bit me!  There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.  Speaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.  But even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.  You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids.  I think I ate them all, but sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember.Things to try: the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips!And thanks Cory and GM (Ben I think?) for making our visit so entertaining, educational and above all...FUN!	good
Ate here on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Nice easygoing ambiance with bold yet comforting modern decor of reds/browns/and touches of green. Attentive service and delicious tapas dishes. Highly recommend the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Cuban Sliders. Note: check-in on 4square for a drink special !	good
This place was great - good food, drinks (caipirinha) , happy-hour, and location.Tried to go there the other night.  Why, oh why, did it close???	neutral
I'm extremely optimistic that this place will earn 5 stars on my next visit when I intend to order off their regular menu!My father and I arrived for happy hour at 6 and were told it had just ended! Luckily the cordial manager Mike let us indulge in happy hour since their yelp ad lists happy hour from 4-7pm.First off, their happy hour prices are so inexpensive!! I posted pictures of the menus- beer $3, Cocktails 4.50, and a glass of wine for $3.50? Absolutely awesome.The watermelon gazpacho was pleasing, but the flavours weren't really intermingled well. One bite would be incredibly delicious, and the next sort of bland. I definitely wouldn't write it off though.Our cocktails were the highlight; my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor. The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria. Sierra Mist is the contributing sweetness : /There was also an interesting selection of South American Beers!Their Hamachi Tiradito was a winner, and entirely cooked as opposed to raw. Raw might have been more delicious, but sashimi isn't exactly tapas.	neutral
We were a little skeptical at first - was told we were limited to the (small) lunch menu. However our server asked the chef who agreed to let us order from the dinner menu if there was something we were interested in (our group of 5). Ceviche-tapas style items were all very good and we were quite pleased. We stayed inside because it was a bit cold outside, but the view (of Townsquare) from the deck looked nice. We would consider going back again some time (we are locals).	neutral
"These are two perplexed stars because several people that I respect have given Cana lots of stars. My preliminary explanation is that people love sugar cane in their drinks; they love it so much that they are driven in a sugar frenzy to giving 4 or more stars. I can respect this. I didn't have any sugar cane drinks. I had a glass of wine and some food.The atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere, but at Cana you pay for the atmosphere. The food was expensive for tapas. We had a ceviche, which was decent. I had no real complaints there, but some of my friends did not think it was the freshest. Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread. For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the ""crispy"" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.  I am willing to grant that perhaps I came on an off night. There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff. If I am at Town Square and someone wants to go back, I wouldn't be a party pooper. However, for now and based on the other reviews, I would say go to Cana for the drinks, but eat at Firefly. The food at Firefly is 50% cheaper and 100% hotter."	bad
I was a bit disappointed with this place. A bunch of us girls decided to go for happy hour and it was just a huge let down. First of all, only certain drinks and food are happy hour priced. Why would we want to come here, when Blue Martini is next door with happy hour on everything?! We decided on a pitcher of the Sugarcane Sangria. The server told us that it was cheaper getting the pitcher, but beware this is full price during happy hour. We also ordered the Mac and Cheese and the Chicken Empanada (this is not a HH item). I thought both were decent, but I definitely would say I wasn't impressed. Overall, I felt disappointed and we left to go to finish Happy Hour at Blue Martini.	bad
"So this is my first yelp and I have read reviews on this site for quite sometime....one thing you will always get from me is an open mind and minimum negativity unless it is truly called for....for cana latin kitchen I will start first off by saying that this....raquel was our server....she was the only one on the floor and kept us happy.....her reccomendations we welcomed with open arms....go see her and I'm sure you will make a night of it for you....We started first of course with some drinks. My boo ordered a strawberry basil margherita....when I asked her if she liked it she simply replied ""this shit is hella good, I'm getting another!!"" I order a cucumber mojito...I like a stiff drink but mine was a little rough....I won't judge it on that as I'm sure every other one they make is excellent. I sent mine back and had it replaced with the diablo dulce. It was different it had some rum pineapple juice habenero and garlic....I'm sure there was some other stuff but I'm a little fuzzy writing this at the moment.We went on to order the chicken empanadas....they were excellent....get them....they were the perfect amount of flaky and crunchy....not too much oil....after that we had the spicy tuna chiviche....it was good as well....big chunks of. We had the ""hamachi"" as well...that was excellent....cut like sashimi but cooked in citrus juice. We were up for more....we decided to ask rauqel what she liked....she said the dates....I said no thanks we are already on one haha (that was corny but who cares its fun)...we ordered the dates and calamari.....the dates were awsome...super sweet and wrapped in bacon....that calamari was just calamari....not too special...we finished off with the short rib tacos......if you decide to visit caña order those for sure....they are good....we were stuffed.....good food, good atmosphere,  and pretty unique drinks......its all reasonable tapas pricing too....go to townsquare and try it if you haven't before.

Had some time before a movie so we decided to try something other than our usual American fare at Town Square and Cana looked intrigueing.  Small plates of food give more chances to taste something different.Order was:Hamachi Chicken EmpanadasBeef EmpanadasChicken SkewersPiggy Back DatesCrispy ShrimpFish TacosShort Rib TacosThe Empanadas and Piggy Back Dates were the best things out of the selections.  I would come back just for those.  Everything else was ok but I wasn't feeling the Short Rib.Cool place to try if you're looking for something a little different from Yardhouse or Cadillac Ranch.	neutral
A friend recommended this tapas spot and I absolutely enjoyed the apps we got except for one. We ordered the meatballs, hamachi, beef tenderloin, calamari and they were all great. We also ordered the Cevichi mushrooms but that was the only fail out of the things we ordered cuz it was very citrusy and a bit sour so we had it sent back and the waitress recommended the spicy tuna and it was very good!Met the General Manager and he hooked it up with their special dessert that evening which was with ice cream, fried bananas and chocolate and like some waffle haha, IT WAS AWESOME!It was a bit pricey for the portions that came out but its a nice place to take a date out to and the atmosphere was really chill... Over all I was pretty impressed myself... I would highly recommend this place as a date spot! :)	good
"First, it is dark and you can't tell if it is even still in business when we were walking up. They need some sort of sign of life out front. We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say ""sorry you just missed Happy Hour"". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good. For sure it won't be until summer. I hate eating in a winter coat. Maybe by summer they will have better service and people watching?"	neutral
We were passing town through and stopped based on the Yelp reviews. Mediocre suburban tex mex; not authentic Mexican which we prefer. Chips and salsa nothing special. Others in my group ordered burritos, which were ok. I ordered the Mexican salad and asked the waitress to add steak. It came as a nice mix of greens, covered in warm, melted Kraft cheddar cheese, no steak. The waitress that brought our food was different from the one who took our order, so seemed confused when I pointed out the steak was missing. However, she came back promptly with a big plate of steak to add to my salad and said it was ok, because my server had it down right but the kitchen missed it. The way she said it made me wonder what would have happened if the waitress had gotten it wrong . . .  Anyway, nothing terrible but I'd probably stop somewhere else next time.	neutral
The blackened chicken quesadilla is amazing!! While the green salsa was a click too spicy for me, the flavor was unreal! I didn't have the margarita, but my sister did and said the taste was great! (It was small, so order a large if you want more) I'm a big guacamole fan and this one again was great. Still too spicy for me, but if you can handle a little heat-you should love it. (BTW, I can barely handle any heat at all, so it's probably normal for most people ;)I say, grab some friends and try it out!	good
Update:  Allegedly this place is closed.  Obviously they did nothing to improve my on my previous review.  The owners of this place own several places in town, some great and some ok, so they obviously could care less what I had to say.  It is about the food!  If you make great food then people will come.I am a sucker for trying every new place around, despite the countless bad reviews I read.  Cabo''s was the latest of the new places I've tried.  Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible.  Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated..  Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok.  If nothing was horrible then why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them.  I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here. The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing.  However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food.  They charge $13.00 for a Fajita and $3.00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it.  That is $16 for a Fajita that would be $9-$12 everywhere else.  The food was not horrible, but it was bland.  The fajitas lacked flavor.  I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something.  When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero then you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant. The service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent.  I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background.   This is usually a worrisome sign for me at any ethnic restaurant, particularly at a Mexican restaurant.  This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated, but I doubt it.  The employees I encountered were pleasant, but the experience was nothing special.  Before you bash me as some white hating individual I must disclose that I'm white.  I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food, but rarely is it ever as good as a person from that particular ethnic background (in this case Mexican). With all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?  I won't, I'll take my business and money elsewhere where I can get a better meal for less.  If you must try it then go ahead as it won't be a horrible experience, but don't say that you weren't warned.	bad
This place is great!! First time dining here but I will definitely be back. We ordered the guac, chicken/fish/shrimp tacos, and a chicken crisp and everything was great! The shrimp tacos were a little spicy, but good. The chicken was my fav! Had a tasty drink too...a blackberry/basil margarita. Highly recommend this restaurant.	good
I needed a place for an office lunch of about 20 people and decided upon Cabo's. John, the general manager, was professional and very friendly upon my initial inquiry and throughout the meal. My group ate in the small area to the right just inside the main door.The service? It could not have been better. Angela and Joy spoke with me prior to the arrival of the other guests to make sure that everything was set up properly and to make sure that the guests would get the best possible service. They did a great job of getting drinks and food orders, offering suggestions, and generally having fun with the diners. Chips and drinks were refilled quickly and all the service was with a smile.Everyone enjoyed their meal. We ordered quite an array of entrees from tacos to fajitas. My meal, the stuffed poblano pepper, was excellent. Angela suggested adding spicy pork to it, but I was determined to have a meat-free meal today. The next time I will definitely try her suggestion. I thought the queso we ordered for our chips was outstanding. People gobbled up the fresh guacamole, which I personally thought needed just a bit more heat. The other suggestion one person made was that his meal also could have used a bit more heat. Needless to say, everyone left quite full and satisfied.After lunch, a few of us relaxed at the bar, making for a great ending to a wonderful experience. Great food, great service and reasonable prices: quite a combination for a Mexican restaurant on the southwest side of Champaign. I have a feeling that several of my group will be returning very soon.	good
I've only had breakfast here and both times our food was outstanding. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the fresh fruit was excellent. The prices are reasonable and a great value IMHO.  The service was great too -- very friendly staff.	good
How does this restaurant only have 3 1/2 stars?? I've been here twice and the food was excellent both times. The steak enchiladas are fantastic, with high quality meat and fresh sauce. The service is good, with friendly and attentive staff. I'm really glad there's a Mexican restaurant out this way and ecstatic that it's this good.	good
Guacamole was dry, we even mixed in salsa but didn't help. Most of the time you find yourself eating your grac, fat b/c it is good...We surrendered and sent it back...sad, this is off to a bad start.  Ok, wow the chips are out of a box...and nasty....Oh no....	neutral
Really wanted to like this place, as it's convenient to our home, and I love good Mexican food.Salsa seemed canned, not very flavorful.  Chips thick, obviously brought it.My husband had the mixed fajitas- amazingly, hardly any flavor.  It came with no more than a teaspoon of guacamole and pico de gallo.  I had the stuffed poblano.  Nothing special.  Just mashed potatoes in a roasted poblano.Service was okay, but food was sub-par at best.  We didn't take the leftovers home, and will not be back.	bad
Muy bien! In a town with more Mexican restaurants per capita than Tijuana, Cabo's certainly stands out above the rest. The decor is way better than El Toro or Dos Reales and I don't get the feeling that I might get salmonella at all. Dos XX Ambar on draftBad Ass Pork TacosChicken EnchiladasDelicious rice with corn in itIt loses one star for just ok service. Some confusion with the wait staff and kitchen. Other than that the experience was excellent. Way to go Cabo's!	good
I second Brian A.'s review. Good vibe, good food, ok service. Quesadillas are not enchiladas. When I did get my enchiladas they were admittedly a little Tex-Mex, but still topped enchiladas from other Mexican restaurants in the area. Earlier reviews state that the beans seem to come from a can...disagree. It's called substance. Overall, great experience and will definitely be trying again to confirm!	good
"*** UPDATE 10/1/2014: Sadly, Cabo's Cantina is now closed.  It was great while it lasted.***We stopped in for an early dinner. We left filled and satisfied.  The food was very good and we will definitely be back. We had cheese curds as an appetizer. They were tasty, but they are breaded and then deep fried and served with a sauce. The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper.  Truly good sauce.  The curds themselves were unexceptional. Too much breading, but that seems common in this part of the country.  (We prefer curds warm and ""naked"" with a spice ""rub"" rather than a sauce. But I'm not complaining. They were good.)The main courses likewise were really good. The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream. But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine.  The squash tacos were a real surprise, especially at a restaurant like this. They were spicy and perfectly done. Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas.  The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings. Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any.  It was piled high and easily shared. And, most important, it was delicious.The chips and salsa were good. The salsa, in fact, was very good. Especially the hot salsa. It was a tomatillo salsa but with lots of peppers but still not really hot.  The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was. None in our party found it exceptional.  The chips were warm and very salty. I couldn't tell for certain, but I don't believe they are made on the premises.  The menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos. And there are many choices in each category. Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much.  It isn't really Mexican; if you are looking for authentic Mexican you should go to Maize or El Charro. The food here is Mexican Inspired. I'm not knocking it. It is delicious. The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more authentic places. The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks.  And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables. The place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack: a lovely decor. Although says Cantina and Grill on the sign, this is a sit-down restaurant if you want it to be.  On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those ""tall tables"" that require high chairs to sit at.  The decor is simple but very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it.  There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days.  The wait staff was wonderful. They would explain any dish you might have questions about, and they make recommendations if you give them guidelines about what you are looking for in a meal.  Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week.  Parking is ample and we were seated immediately. The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask.All in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign! I suspect it will become one of our regular stops."	good
"What a lunch!! I cannot wait to come back here for dinner, this time with my husband. When I took my first bite of the pork taco, there were so many flavors bursting in my mouth! It was spicy and juicy! Pork was cooked so perfectly! My mouth was definitely in heaven. Next, I had the most amazing spinach salad. There was a mild curry flavor and the tangerines and onions made it so crisp and fresh! That has been the best salad I have ever had. But I have to say, that the winner of it all for me at least is the sauce that came with the cheese curds. I am calling it the ""Magic Sauce"". I hope the owners would start bottling that sauce and having it for sale. I would definitely stock my pantry up with it. What I liked most is the variety they had. I even had a fabulous burger that was mildly spiced and had a cumin type flavor to it. Unfortunately for me, it was lunch time and since I had to go back to work, I did not have a cocktail. Looking forward to going there again soon with my husband and getting some cocktails as well. I hope this place never goes out of business. Great location too!"	good
I went to Cabo's the first time for dinner because Billy Barooz (same owner,same strip mall) was on a wait list. It was marginal, but had only been open a short time.  We had tamales, stuffed chili, a burger and pork tacos.  Tamales were all dough with a bland salsa verde.  The tacos are described as spicy, and they were - way hot cayenne.  Service was OK, rushed, but everything got there.  The second trip was way better, service was friendly, and relaxed.  They were not as crowded.  We had burgers, and steak tacos.  I had the Black Jack burger with fried jalapeno, cheese, and two beef patties.  It stood about four inches tall and had a great beef flavor.   A side order of cheese curds was way overcooked though.  This place will continue to get better as the staff settles in, and the kitchen gets sorted out.	good
"First let me say that I love Mexican food and really wanted to like this place since it is very close to my office.  I went there for lunch with some co-workers.  The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in.  The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn't that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made ""in house so they are extra yummy.""  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.They have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price/one size.  This was disappointing.I ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.The burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then ""grill"" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that's not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.  Don't waste your time or money.I prefer to support locally owned business, especially restaurants since I worked in the industry for a long time, but this was just overall a very bad experience."	bad
My girlfriend and I came in around 5 PM on a Saturday. Wasn't too busy and we were quickly seated. The waitress brought us chips and salsa. She was very prompt and helpful. Throughout our visit she was very quick to refill our drinks.After quickly looking over the menu we both decided on getting the chimichanga. (My personal favorite) It seemed like the food took a bit longer than we were expecting but not too bad.Once our order arrived, it looked delicious. However, that was not the case. As others have mentioned, the black beans have an off taste. The rice is pretty bland and underwhelming. Both the rice and beans were cold. The chimichanga is filled mostly with rice and beans which didn't help. Unfortunately, the entire meal was just rather mediocre.Although the food wasn't the greatest, you do get large portions. My girlfriend and I decided if we tried coming again, we might just split an entree. She said she would give the restaurant 3 out of 5.Honestly, I couldn't recommend going here. The food just wasn't that good. Hopefully, they can improve and perhaps we can try it again.	bad
"Champaign is full of middling but not terrible places for Mexican food. You get your food in seconds, but it's pretty much just the same ingredients shuffled around in different combinations, and each component is not all that great. Not BAD, but not great. I think this is the first truly great place for Mexican I've eaten at in Champaign, which is why I'm throwing caution to the wind and actually giving it a full five stars.I just started going a few weeks ago, and I've been there three times since. I've always found the wait staff to be really pleasant. They do get pretty busy during dinner, but I've never had a terrible wait and usually get seated right away. It might help that I tend to eat dinner a little earlier, if possible.You get chips and salsa, of course, to start at no charge. Their chips were fresh and light and warm. Nothing is a bad sign like bad tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. I have tried the guacamole and the queso. Of the two, I preferred the queso as an add-on dip for the Nachos. The guacamole was okay, but it could have used more lime, and I prefer my guac a bit chunkier.Possibly the best thing on their menu are their crisps, which are like little mini-pizzas on a tortilla-based ""crust."" The crust of them is perfect. Delicate and flaky and crispy, which you'd hope based on the name. I've had bites of two different crisps-the pork and the red pepper varieties. I preferred the pork overall, but both were full of flavor. Their cheese and sauces seem of a very good quality and are very flavorful.I've also tried their pork tacos. The tortillas uses for their tacos (white corn, I believe) are great. Soft, with a little bit of texture and tooth to them. I did think their pork could used a tad more heat, but other than that they made a good lunch portion with the chips.Desert-wise, you must try their fried ice-cream! It's the best I've ever had. It seems like a hard thing to mess up too badly, but plenty of Mexican places that bother to offer it, do. It has a sweet, flaky crust and delicious chocolate drizzle. It might be nice if you got two coated, smaller scoops of ice cream instead of one larger one, just to balance out the crust and ice cream proportions a bit better. Still, it's delicious.As far as drinks go, I have had two of their Margaritas. The first was a Blackberry and Basic concoction, and was my favorite of the two. I didn't get a ton of basil from it, but there was enough there to make it interesting. The other was a pineapple and coconut Margarita. This had a great taste, though I didn't get much coconut from it other than the toasted coconut on the rim of the glass. Neither skimped on the alcohol."	good
So let me first say that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like the place-- especially after so many positive reviews. Food: HOLF SH*T SALTY. I mean SALTY. Like hey, want some food as a side to your jug of morton's salt with that? Now, I am not one of those people on a low sodium diet, where you body goes into shock consuming salt. I consider myself having a pretty normal diet. The guacamole was salty. Black beans couldn't even taste beans because it was sooo salty. Rice was mushy and had no flavor at all. I tried my husband's chicken burrito, and it was salt with chicken essence. We wouldn't even bag it up for our dogs to eat. I had the cheese enchiladas. HORRIBLE. It was like a really bad quesadilla with some red sauce on it. No use of Mexican cheeses-- just really shitty kraft cheese that my knife wouldn't even cut through. Service: Meh. Had to ask the bartenders for menus as no one was coming to our table. Server was new and didn't know the menu when we had a couple questions. When she saw that I only ate a bite of my food, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong or how she could fix it. Big no no. I was a server for 5 years and you just know when something isn't right with your customers. Drinks: Meh. I had the blackberry margarita, which tasted of only blackberry syrup. Needed to be cut with fresh lime juice. We left with both of us wanting to throw up and head to the sauna to sweat out the salt. Seriously eating bad Chinese food and a bunch of sunflower seeds would still be less salt than this place. Basically if you like suburb quality Mexican food that uses frozen and not fresh ingredients come here.	bad
Great dining experience with the food and service. The margaritas are tasty and the veggie burrito, in particular, is fantastic.	good
I've tired to go to cabo's twice now. once when I thought they had just opened but I guess things didn't work out so they were not open? and tonight when they closed at 7 for a Christmas party. thankfully billy barooz's was open. I'm not happy about this because it is out of my way so I will probably not make the trip there again.	bad
I went there for breakfast this morning and the food was great. I had the steak and eggs. The service and atmosphere were also good.	good
Went here Saturday afternoon around 1:30 and the place was dead.  It took forever to be waited on.  Once we ordered then we waited what seemed like a very long time to get our food.  The food was not edible.  The black beans were chalky and cold and had a funny flavor.  They serve the Chimichanga with rice and beans on the outside and on the inside.  I ordered a chicken Chimichanga but all that was in it was rice and beans and not very good rice and beans either!  I ordered a classic margarita and it was good but it's about a 4 ounce glass and cost $7.  Get real!!!!The inside is really nice (just like Smoke Que and Brew) but the service and the food suck!  I will not go back for a second try to this place.  I would have had anyone working there really cared about anything but they did not.  They didn't even have the Illini game on until we asked them to turn it on.	bad
I was so anxious for this place to open and when it did I was thoroughly impressed! I work and live nearby so having a place to eat good Mexican food is a must! The menu is just great.  Lets talk drinks first.  I'm definitely a margarita lover so having Cabo's wide selection was awesome! Instead of regular sour mix they make fresh lime juice and organic agave nectar! How cool! The Roasted Blackberry and Basil Margarita by far is delicious. This combo goes great together.  However, my personal favorite is the Platinum Margarita. Instead of Triple sec, this one calls for a high quality and tasty ingredient called Grand Marnier--it makes the flavor so much better!So food. To start off, the chips and salsa must be good at a Mexican place, and this place surely scores a 10 by me! The stuffed poblano is really what hits the spot for me, but I do love a good taco! And this is definitely the place for that!Overall this place is a winner for me. Everyone is so nice, food is great, and the drinks are awesome! I really can't wait for warm weather so the patio is open!	good
Best  pizza crust in Vegas! The service was fast, friendly and orderly. Ordered the Canadian bacon with pineapple toppings, just as great as every time I've eaten. Also ordered the side Caesar salad and Mac and cheese. yum o. recommend for tasty fast food in between the gambling and movies.	good
This Sbarro is now CLOSED at the Texas Station Casino...that's too bad because I had a free slice on a coupon and I found it to be quite good.  Went back today and found it shut down due to Sbarro's bankruptcy.  So, that's the latest!	good
Ah, Sbarro: the mainstay of every mall or food court since I can remember. With their large pizzas, variety of sides, and large drinks, how can you not like this place?On my last trip here, I came with some friends to get some food in our systems before/during/after beers. We all three ordered the meal which consisted of a slice of pizza, a delicious side, and a drink. In my case, I got a pepperoni pizza, toasted mini potatoes, and a Pepsi. I should mention that they had like 5 different kids of pizza ready to serve up (pepperoni, ham/pineapple, cheese, sausage, jalapeno, stuffed...) which they warm up for you really quickly before serving it. As for the quality of my pizza? It was good. It was nothing to write home about, but it was good. I think the crust was kinda bland, but otherwise I was happy with it. The little potatoes they served me were pretty good, too. My friends ordered the pasta on the side, and they were happy with their food selections as well. As a matter of fact, they were happy enough with their sides that they ate them before the pizza and said it was a 5-star meal, though I was erring on the side of 3. (Thus the four-star rating)Service here is always pretty quick and simple. Prices are ok (I paid like 7.80 for the meal, which is pretty good for the amount of food!) I'll keep coming back here when I'm in the Texas, for sure!	good
My husband still currently working on having a massive coronary before 35 loves this place.  I stop here after work to pick up food for my grease loving hubby.  The folks who work here alway have a smile on their face, though I may be a little bias seeing as they see me at least once a week.  The food is pretty much the same as any other Sbarro but the people who work here make it a fun quick little trip.	good
"I remember when this place was Farmer Boy back in the late 90s. Always big portions of good food, friendly service, and open 24/7. It has gone through a few name changes since then but has been Luna's for the past several years. My really good experiences here have outweighed the not so great experiences. I consider it a ""locals"" spot, so it's not five star dining by any stretch. But the portions are still good-sized, and there are generally daily specials for a good price. I miss the old Farmer Boy restaurant, but I think Luna's is still a good option to consider if you're looking for a good meal for a reasonable price."	good
Worse than a grade school cafeteria canned food. Only bright spot... it is definitely low salt.French toast was mushy and nasty.Coffee smelled burnt... but had no taste. Asked non coffee drinking husband to try and he agreed.No matter the coupon... not worth the meal.	bad
My wife and I both ordered the rib eye steak dinner for $10.99.  It came with a choice of soup or salad (we chose the salad with a delicious Greek house dressing), giant baked potato and mixed vegetables (out of a can), and free dessert (choice of ice cream or rice pudding - we chose rice pudding and brought it home.  The steaks were slightly over-cooked and not great, but not bad, smothered in onions and mushrooms (out of a can).  The baked potatoes were the highlight of the meal.  Luna's is an old-fashioned kind of restaurant, not very busy on a Saturday night.  Good service (she forgot the dinners rolls, but got them immediately when we asked) and very good value.  We will be back.	neutral
"Food is bland. Reminds me of hospital food. chicken soup was a big bowl  but truly had only one small cube of chicken in it. Vegetables have been reheated multiple times resulting in the peas being hard as rocks. Mashed potatoes were ""instant.""  Coffee is good. Waitress was nice and kept refilling my coffee. I won't go back, however."	bad
This place was fine for breakfast, the greek scramble was tasty and hearty. Nice owners, very fast (even curt) servers but overall friendly enough. Don't expect gourmet and you won't be disappointed. Decor is about three decades out of date though. Not sure why some reviewers are so down on this place.	neutral
We used to enjoy Luna's for breakfast. The last 2 times the food has been bad. The main reason we won't go back, the last time we were in our waitress went to the wrong table, realized it then cussed. No big deal if my child wasn't with us. Poor service and lousy food. Great prices though. Hopefully it gets better.	bad
"This place used to be Five Points Deli & Restaurant, I don't know if it was an ownership change or just a name change.  I'm not considering this a full review, since we just stopped in here for dessert and coffee.  I'll have to come back for an actual MEAL, and do more of a review then.3 of us ordered desserts (2 slices of cake, one of the apple pie).  Received ginormous portions (especially of the cake, 3 of us could split one slice of that).  Everything was tasty, but not made on-premises (I actually think I saw packaging from Sam's in the dessert case on the way out).  Decent value for the money.  This area doesn't have many options if you've got the taste for dessert (other than ice cream) and don't want to whip up some brownies.Food I saw on other tables all looked pretty good.  Pleasant server, decent ""diner-style"" ambiance.  Pretty extensive menu, especially for breakfast.  Spotless bathroom.I'll have to swing by here soon.  I think the Corned Beef Hash is calling out to me!"	neutral
Stopped in here Mother's Day for breakfast because every other place was packed. Don't usually come here for the same reasons mentioned in other reviews about service, cleanliness, etc. Again, got the same put out attitude from the servers and slimy table top near the kitchen. The big thing that got me this time was as the wife and I sat there waiting for our food, one of the bus boys who was apparently on his break and looked to be one of the owners relatives, reached over our table to grab some ketchup to put on HIS plate of eggs! He was in clear view and in the way of the service traffic. Nobody that worked there said a word to this oaf as he chowed down! We just looked at each other and laughed in disbelieve! Good thing we don't use ketchup on our eggs! The funniest thing was after we got our food the the tide of people that came in behind us must have overwhelmed them! The staff looked horrified like they didn't expect this much overflow on Mother's Day or capable of handling it! Only got one refill of coffee in this panicked frenzy of pisses off staff and patrons! As we left the owner took our money with a smile as if he was oblivious to the chaos going on behind him! Wow! Last time, no more!	bad
Must have the Luna's Corned Beef sandwich.... Amazing.	good
My husband and I were out for a Sunday drive when we spotted this restaurant and decided to stop for dinner.  After a quick visit to the clean restroom, we were greeted and seated immediately.  Three menus appeared...  Daily specials, breakfast menu, and the full menu.  We chose to go to the dinner route.  Our waitress could not have been more helpful.  On her recommendation, we both chose the fried chicken dinner.  It was crunchy, slightly sweet, and oh so good!  It came with potato, rolls, corn, and either soup or salad.  I had the Italian wedding soup which was delicious.... Not heavy on celery taste, although clearly there was celery added.  Dinner comes with a scoop of ice cream for dessert, if you like.  We felt lucky to find this place.  Our waitress was so attentive, never missing a beat.  If we lived closer, we would definitely be back!	good
I like this restaurant. I've been coming here since I was in high school. Fun-loving people with a good sense of humor. Food is so good with big portions you can never go wrong with that.	good
Food is terrible... Frozen and canned crap.  We went there for dinner.  The food literally had no taste, the service was slow.  I won't go back there if you paid me.The people rating this place more than 2 stars are delusional.   I would rather step in front of a bus than eat at this sh@thole again... You've been warned.	bad
Found Luna's through Yelp and glad we did. Great service and quality food at low prices. The parking lot was full but we didn't have a long wait. Hubs ordered biscuits and gravy with eggs which he scarfed down. I had a denver omlette bagel sandwich which was delicious. So glad we stopped.	good
I had the chicken noodle soup which was the strangest tasting I've ever had. The fish fry was extremely greasy as well. The staff wasn't very friendly and as I was leaving I noticed that all of the bakery in the display case was purchased from WalMart..	bad
Terrible customer service today! My husband and I came today for breakfast with our 4 kids. We're used to waiting for a table... We waited for 20min and then a local family who new one of the owners came in. 5 people in their party and they went out of their way to push tables together and say them before us. We left! In the past my husband and I have enjoyed the restaurant and always have the same waitress who is good to us. So sad that because of today I won't be back.	bad
Glad we went back a second time -- for all the wrong reasons!  First visit, owner could not have been friendlier, server was attentive & friendly, my AYCE cod dinner came with delicious lentil soup & canned or frozen corn, french fries were good, wife's sandwich was decent if not memorable, kitchen did a good job in getting orders out, restrooms were clean, dining area was orderly.  But the second trip -- had the fried cod dinner again, and there was something N-O-T Q-U-I-T-E R-I-G-H-T about it, tartar sauce wasn't even fully mixed, in place of the corn I had mixed (ugh!) veggies, french fries almost soggy, rice pudding had a liberal dose of cinnamon but it was still thin and tasteless, owner too busy on a personal phone call to say hello.  The good news -- our server was excellent, the kitchen got orders out quickly again, the rest rooms still clean, the dining room still neat and orderly.  the lentil soup was still quite good.  Weren't there for breakfast, but their breakfast menu looks good, with eggs, omelettes, waffles, skillets, etc.   Go east or west on Route 82 for some better options.	bad
"Someone recommended Luna's and so earlier today I thought I would give it a try for dinner.  Well, not a good decision.After reviewing the menu I decided to try something 'safe' so I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The meat loaf had very little seasoning, if any.  It had an odd taste.  It also appeared to be overcooked around the edges.  There was quite a 'crust' on it.  Overall, not appetizing at all.  The 'mashed' potatoes were quite lumpy.  I had to finish mashing them with the fork.  It appeared they had been mashed quickly, possibly just before they were served.  Again, lack of seasoning, particularly salt.  Not good at all.   I didn't finish either item.And when I tried to pay my check, there was no one at the register.  I probably stood there about 3 minutes before another customer got in line behind me.  She finally summoned a waiter and asked if we could pay our bills.  The response was, ""I don't know where she is.""  He then disappeared for a moment and then returned and said ""She will be with you in a minute.""   Not good customer service.The whole meal was not very good.  While the price was reasonable, the food didn't live up to the hype that I received.  I don't think I would either recommend this place or go there again.  There are better places with food that is more appetizing.   A real disappointment for sure."	bad
will not go back.  went for breakfast & ordered waffles, they were horrible.  not sure how a restaurant could mess up waffles so badly, such a basic food to prepare.  not impressed at all, dont waste your time/money.	bad
We love Luna's. We are there every Friday Morning. Breakfast is inexpensive for what you get.  It's the local breakfast place, not a chain with fancy meals and prices	good
Horrific food, horrific service. We had a frozen burger and a wilted salad of iceburg lettuce that was way over seasoned. The waitress brought the check before the food and didn't check on us again. Obviously prepared food with shortcuts. I am very disappointed.	bad
I walked in and first of all it smelled like mold and i smelled the bathrooms from the front door. The wait was short, however, the server almost didn't notice that I was there. it seemed like there was no host to seat me. The server asked politely, if i would like a table or booth. I asked for a booth. I was seated and the server, asked, what can i get you to drink. I ordered my drink and the server left. As I am drinking my pop, the server finally brings me the menu and leaves again. As I am looking at the menu I noticed there were family members of the owner/manager (maybe), helping out in which I thought was cute? But kind of weird! I thought that it was sweet that a family business was helped by togetherness of family members. As I am waiting for the server to return  to take my order I noticed that some of the tables were dirty and the floor was sticky. It seemed  that the tables were not properly wiped off. The server finally came back to take my order, i ordered the corn beef and fries instead of cabbage  and a salad with oil and vinegar then hums as an appetizer. I sat and waited for my order for about 15-20 minutes. The owner/manager was walking around helping out his family members. That's a good owner/manager helping out. The server brought out the salad with the dressings. I notice that the dressing  bottle was very dirty, The rest of the food came out all at once instead of the appetizer first. The hummus did not taste like hummus. The hummus was very tasteless. The corn beef was bland and the carrots tasted like  they came from a can from the store. The fries tasted as if they were prefrozened  and prepared from a bag instead of fresh. After looking at the dessert i remember seeing the brand of cake sold at walmart... not fresh.	bad
For some reason, even though there were only a few tables with diners, our waitress seated us right by the kitchen. She kept coming over and rushing us to make a decision.  When I say rushing I mean like every minute or so.   Seriously. The Chicken Noodle Soup looked like glorified boxed soup.  The salad had lettuce that was starting to rust.  Someone must really like onions because there were 7 large slices of red onion on it.  But, here is the best part was the dressing came in a squeeze package like the ones at fast food places.  The meatloaf was horrible but strangely the mashed potatoes were good.  The fried chicken was OK. They make it with honey so chicken is very sweet and not something I'd eat again.  The fries were typical frozen french fries but were OK.  If the food wasn't disappointing enough, all of the servers had bad attitudes and it showed.  We could hear all the talk from the kitchen since we were so close.  It is obvious no one wants to be there.  They don't care about the quality of their food or service. Now we know why the parking lot was almost empty on a Friday night.  We will not be back for another try.   Someone should write to Robert Irvine.  Maybe him and Restaurant Impossible can help.  Or, maybe not.	bad
Inedible slop. If you've seen those kitchen rescue shows, then the worst of those is this place. Under cooked meat, powdered potatoes, gravy and veggies from a can. I didn't even get a doggie bag despite eating only two bites. I value my pups more than that. Avoid at all cost!	bad
Food is always good service is sometimes iffy, but that's ok. They have great sandwiches and soup. Will always come back	good
"Gross, dirty, poor service, and crappy food to boot! Will never come back to this garbage ""restaurant"". The waitress was rude and seem annoyed that I brought children to eat with me. The charged me for a glass of water if you can imagine. My sandwich was soggy as were the fries. Avoid this place!"	bad
I really enjoy Luna's for breakfast. Local restaurant with friendly staff. Food is normally served very fast, and its really good. Location of the place is very comfortable. I recommend to try it if you're in the area.	good
Die Kugel Eis im Straßenverkauf kosten 1,20 Euro, was ich schon etwas teuer finde. Das Eis schmeckt gut und es gibt eine gute Auswahl an verschiedenen Eissorten. Es war aber nicht überraschend gut, was man bei diesem Preis vielleicht erwarten könnte. Sehr loben muss ich die Eiswaffel. Ich hatte zwei Kugel in der Waffel und die Waffel war die beste, die seit langem in einer Eisdiele bekommen habe. Die Waffel war groß, knusprig und lecker. Ab und zu werde ich bestimmt wieder vorbeischauen.	good
"We have been twice and more than happy both times.Typical convenient store, with a nice hot kitchen with plenty to choose from... Pizza by the slice, whole pizzas, chicken, subs, etc.First trip: we each had the Italian sub (hot) and split an order of chicken tenders & jojos.  The Italian subs were great!  We were more than impressed.  For an Italian sub, it was as good as it gets.  The jojos were decent... Good size, ok flavor.  The tenders left much to be desired... Too bland for our liking.Second trip: we each had the Italian subs (of course!) and split a snack pack (4 whole wings & 2 jojos).  the subs, they were as good as the first time!  These subs are probably 8"", not the biggest but, big enough and with great flavor!  The jojos were as they were the first time but the wings were delicious!  Much more flavor then the tenders.  On our next trip, we'll go for a mixed bucket of chicken for sure!"	good
Good pizza whether you order or are on the go. You can't beat the 4.99 lunch special. Great subs, hot or cold.	good
A convenient store with a good hot kitchen. You can either order a pizza or sub or you can take advantage of their hot and ready pizza by the slice. There is a sign on the deli cooler that says if you spend $20 in groceries you get a free pizza. I'm not sure if that's for any grocery items in the store or only items from the deli. I have been going here for years and there have been a lot of different employees over the last 10 years. I have never had a bad customer experience at this location though. The staff is always very friendly. Especially for some of the people they put up with on a daily basis since this place isn't in the best area. I do highly recommend this place for the pizza by the slice if you aren't too uppity to visit a store in a low income area. There are some sketchy looking characters around sometimes but nobody has ever bothered me in the 10 years I've been going there. Everybody just minds their own business and moves on just as it should be. So stop by and grab a few slices of pizza and don't forget to get a Cold Classic Glass Bottled Coke to go with it.	good
Chapman's is a nice little convenience store in a neighborhood across from a boarded up house in Lorain.The two people I've encountered working there are the friendliest people you'll meet. The young man is the cashier and the older lady works the kitchen. They make a great team.The kitchen serves up hot, made to order pizzas (also available by the slice), subs, fried chicken, and jojos at very reasonable prices!  Fellow Yelper, Darren R has been raving about the delicious Fiery Gauntlet sub for a while and he has reason to because that sammich and the Italian sub I've tried have been really tasty!  They come loaded with savory deli meat and cheese sliced fresh in house with fresh, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion finished with a smidgen of creamy Italian dressing, nicely toasted on a seasoned hoagie roll...all for around $4-$5.49.  I've had the pizza by the slice and it's pretty good at $1.69 for one slice or $2.99 for two slices!  You can order a whole pizza any way you'd like it too. The fried chicken looked really fresh and juicy also. Maybe I'll give they a try next time after I'm off my clean eating kick.  This last visit was a cheat meal, I swear!	good
We came in because it looked like it was small mom and pop restaurant.There was a family and 2 other couples there.  It's a small space.  Prices arereasonable.  Home cooked style meals.  We ordered an entree of steak, calamari,and grilled cod.  There are several sides to order from.  We thought it was a good meal.  Prices were reasonable.	good
Rhum Corner was closed so we walked on and found this place! It was empty, but we sat down anyways. We were starved. We ordered the fish cakes and shrimp patties- for starters. They were fresh and delicious. Piping hot, I tell ya. We were stuffed before our quarter chicken dinners came. But when they arrived, hot with fresh veggies and rice...not to forget the grilled chicken, our greedy sides kicked in and we dug in. It truly is very very good food. I felt like I had a really good home cooked meal. I had leftovers to take home. Don't go in here if you are on a strict diet, that is not going to stick! Haha	good
"I was lost somewhere around Queen street in a snowstorm with a gurgling, uneasy feeling in my stomach when I came across this place. All it took was the words ""Churrasqueira"" on the sign to convince me to step inside and abandon my plans of going to the gym. I'd never heard of a Churrasqueira before, but it sounded kinda like ""Carniceria,"" which always means good food.I parked my bike in front of a be-toqued hobo and crossed the threshold. This place is the real deal. Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine. A baba-from-the-old-country-looking lady sat in a corner, monologuing to a group men standing around in jackets and scarves. Everyone seemed like they belonged here, like they either worked for the place or were related to someone who did. Some hilarious over-the-top foreign soap opera played in the corner, unwatched.About the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old ""hi there, let me know if you have any questions!"" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen. I'd hoped I made a good first impression, because this girl became my rock. Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend.Initially, I had planned to grab the food and go, but the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals. I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it; waitress girl brought out some bread and butter. Ahhhh yeaa, I was gonna make of night of this.Before I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived. The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce. It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto.The chicken was fantastic. Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices. It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on. The potatos, too, were remarkable: salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying. However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce. This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor. It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes.All too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed. I felt truly good. Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit. I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome. I think the waitress even called me cute at the end there. Ahh yeaa."	good
Hidden gem?  Maybe, maybe not...Tasty and good value?  Definitely!This completely unassuming super authentic Portuguese place is located in currently trendifying and hipsterfying part of Dundas West between Bathurst and Ossington.  Decor is minimal with a TV.  Expect to see lots of Portuguese families in this casual, casual joint.The FOOD was all decent with some hits and misses.  The grouper was quite tasty, although we weren't sure that it was actually grouper.  The half chicken was probably the best dish of the night and came with a delightfully spicy dipping sauce.  The steak, which I ordered medium rare,  was served on the well done side of well done; however, the flavor was actually good.  I don't get why places ask about steak temperatures if it's not going to make a difference anyway.  Fries were pretty limp.SERVICE was friendly and very casual.  Definitely not a place to come if you're in a rush.  The food took a long time to come out, but the free bread and olives helped with the wait.  OVERALL. the VALUE is good.  Most of the entrees are in the $8-$13 range.  Drinks are fairly reasonable as well.  It doesn't quite rate as a hidden gem, but I'll call it a hidden cubic zirconium.	neutral
Wir waren gestern mit einem Daily Gutschein da und waren sehr positiv überrascht.Das Steak war sehr lecker,auch die Beilagen.Der Service war auch sehr nett.Wir werden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen.Wir waren rundum zufrieden.	good
Wurden durch einen Aktions-Flyer auf das Steakrestaurant Montero in Stuttgart Schönberg aufmerksam.Wir nahmen die Einladung auf ein Glas Prosecco am Sa.(06.11.10.) an. Hatten einen tollen Abend freundliches Personal , stimmiges Ambiente , frisches argentinisches Rindfleisch auf den Punkt gegrillt . Kleines Minus man sollte immer Bargeld dabei haben,leider Kreditzahlung nicht möglich aber dafür haben die Preise ein dickes Plus verdient. Wir werden nicht mehr in die Stadt fahren. Ein echter Geheim-Tipp.	good
Wir waren zu viert mit einem Daily Gutschein zum Fleischessen. Das Huftsteak war sehr gut und perfekt gegrillt (Metro-Ware). Die Vorspeisenplatte war variantenreich, reichlich und lecker. Freundlicher Service - nicht immer der Schnellste, aber sehr zuvorkommend. Das Steakhouse gibt es seit 2009 dort und wir kommen sicher wieder.	good
Ich wurde durch die Seite DailyDeal auf dieses Restaurant aufmerksam. Zum Essen gabe es ein argentinisches Steak mit Salatbüffet und Beilage. Da wir zu viert waren, hatte uns der Kellner angeboten einen großen Beilagenteller zu machen. Das war echt eine super idee. Viel Auswahl und auch vollkommen ausreichen. Wir sind definitiv ohne Hunger aus dem Restaurant rausgegangen und haben einen schönen Abend verbracht, mit sehr nettem Personal. Das Essen war echt super und das Steak war so wie es sein muss. Nur zu empfehlen und auf jeden Fall ein Besuch wert ;-)	good
I've had a tough time finding steak around this area that compares with what I'm used to having back home. Finally found one! It can be a bit on the pricy side, but that's to be expected for a place like this. When I'm looking to go out for steak, I'll be going here from now on! FYI -  Its off the beaten path on the edge of a neighborhood where you would least expect to find a restaurant.	good
Little hole in the wall but the sushi was amazing! and so different!	good
I work at the mall and usually eat here on my lunch breaks. The food is pretty tasty, price for a two item plate is about $6-$7, and the service is decent. I'm not complaining :)	good
Located in the food court at the Boulevard mall. I love this place! The have the most amazing terriyaki bowls. The bowls cost $5.89 and are plenty to fill even those with a pretty big appetite. I haven't really tasted any of the combos but they are priced between $6-$7. The only thing I don't like about it is the location. Must eat when at the mall! We even drive there once in a blue moon just for the food.	good
Kind of place that makes Lakewood a great place to live. Food decent and service is kind- kept coffee hot and didn't rush us.  Place is like a trip back in time - a classic 80 year old diner with mahogany panels everywhere. It's shaped so you don't feel crowded even though it's long and rectangular.  Years ago it was always too smoky but no longer thanks to smoking ban! CASH only.	good
Old fashioned dinner car.  If you are looking for a solid plate of old fashioned belly filler, consider this place!	good
I love this place. It has that classic diner feel. The food is very good, comes out fast, and they give you a lot for the money. And speaking of money, the food is all cheap!I usually get the breakfasts, and the corn beef hash is the best I have ever had. The other breakfast items I have tried are all great as well.	good
Very small, but delicious food and good price. The owner is a super nice guy. When you get an omelette as big as your head and it's ~$6 you know you have found your breakfast place to be.This all being said, sometimes service can be a little slow, but nothing too bad.	good
John's is a fixture in Lakewood and a great place to get some home cookin'.  You'll get good basics here-eggs, burgers, BLT's, etc.  I'm less sure of fancier grub here and that holds true for diners in general.Love the old diner feel here.  This is a classic train car style diner with the long counter and booths.  Your coffee cup will never go empty and the service is almost always fast and friendly.	neutral
Everytime I'm in the Cleveland/Lakewood area I stop here. It gives you an old-time diner feel with excellent food and service. The prices are great and I always leave filled from the amount of food included. Highly recommend!	good
I thought I'd never get to 500 reviews! Now that I finally have, I thought I'd review one of my favorite types of establishments -- a no-frills diner.My mom, 2-year-old, and I dropped into John's on a Wednesday at 10:30. I was pleased at how quiet and drowsy it was inside, yet we still got greeted enthusiastically and the waitress tended to us right away. Something tells me that if we were to come in at the same time on a Saturday, it would have been packed, but we would have still been acknowledged and served in an efficient manner. It's just that type of place and seems to be run really smoothly.Two things I was surprised about: their corned beef hash is, like, REAL. No crap out of a can (though I will always hold a special place in my heart for that salty gruel). It tasted great and came out fast. The second thing: they have a sign on the table boasting their own root beer made with cane sugar. I hate root beer, but that's pretty impressive. My daughter had a short stack of blueberry hotcakes and we had more than half left over because they were huge and hearty. My mom requested that her omelette be made with egg whites only, and they did that with no problem. The coffee wasn't AMAZING, but it was better than average, hot, and the refills kept coming. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive.Pretty much a great diner experience that I'll be sure to repeat in the near future!	good
"Once again it was great! Went there for breakfast today.  Spoke to John as I always do. What a nice guy. I have been going there 32 years. I had the ""John's omelette""  withmushrooms,cheese,tomato, onion, and hash browns-excellent! My son had the ""crab meat omelette"" he said it was great also. I can't believe all the breakfast selections, so manyomelettes. So many choices and less $$ than all the others. You like home cooking?Go to John's diner, that cozy at home feeling."	good
Ah John's.....this is a good ol' classic car diner. Much of the inside is original - booths, counter, stools, hat racks, etc. Food is good, standard diner fare. Nothing outstanding but still solid. My friend says their pancakes are the best she's ever had. I've never had them as I'm not much of a pancake eater, but she's a connoisseur so I'll take her word for it. As for cleanliness - I've definitely eaten in cleaner joints. I've never been in the bathroom, not even sure if they have one. Also, I wouldn't look at the floor if I were you...The reason John's gets 4 and not 3, is they have what I call a great 'diner waitress'. A great diner waitress is somebody who is very efficient, never misses anything, and always keeps your coffee hot. She calls you 'hun' or 'sweetie' but it somehow isn't patronizing like it is when other people say it. Don't know her name and she's very young but she is great and is always there. John's is a classic type place - looks rough on the outside, not too far behind on the inside, but will serve you up a good, hot meal quickly and cheaply.  Oh, yeah - CASH ONLY.	good
I have to update my review, the last few times I've been in here it's smelled so much like sewage when I walked in I had to leave.  The area where you eat is very dirty, makes you wonder what the area you don't see looks like.  I wish they would clean and possible update and raise their prices if they have to, otherwise I can't eat here anymore.	bad
John's is like stepping back in time ... in all the best ways! The food is simple but well-prepared. The portions are generous. The service is friendly and attentive. And the prices, well, unbelievably easy on your wallet. Case in point: the special breakfast: 2 French toast slices (or pancakes); 2 slices bacon; 2 sausage links; and 2 eggs prepared to order ... $4.95!! I almost feel guilty ordering it. Definitively a unique place with old-fashioned values.	good
I'm sorry to say I only just got to John's Diner for the first time this weekend. This is the archetype of a greasy spoon diner.  It's been around forever (apparently at least since the 1930's), is well worn, a little cramped, dirt cheap, and delicious.  We went for breakfast on a Sunday, and were really happy to find a simple, classic, menu of breakfast fare (with an option of dinner-served all day).  Eggs, meat (including country-fried steak!), pancakes, gravy, etc. - you know the drill.  Sit down, someone will take your order soon, and shortly thereafter it will arrive on some well-used dishes for you to devour.  A little while later, a bill will arrive on your table and you'll be surprised at how little your full belly cost.	good
Your standard old-school breakfast diner. The staff is mostly older but they make sure you're taken care of. Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous. My friend and I make it our regular spot on Sunday mornings!	good
I always go there on sundays for breakfast, the food is ok the people who works here are very nice, nothing special, just dinner food. Its cheap and convenient, nothing out of the ordinary.	neutral
Its an old school diner, a good atmosphere and the food is good if you like greasy spoons. no frills. i've been going here since i was 7years old and always have a good time and a full stomach at a good price.	good
"I like a restaurant that doesn't really care about me.  Too many restaurants slink around your ankles like beaten dogs, cravenly asking, ""Do you want anything, sir?  Please?  Yes, I can get it for you, restaurant-Gollum loves the master, we adoreses you...""John's Diner will serve you, but on its own terms.  They treat you like people; they're happy to see you, but they've been around for fifty years and will be around for fifty more.  The waitresses tell you what's going on in the back, complain merrily about the job, bring your food to you, pat you on the shoulders.  They have that quiet pride that says, ""If you behave well, you're part of the family here.  If not, here's the door.""  I didn't ask for anything special, but one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, ""Now, what did you want THAT for?""As such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere.  This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter.  The food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon, but that's actually part of the charm; they don't care about eating healthy, they want you to eat hearty.  They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional but it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget.Would I recommend this to my snooty foodie friends?  No.  But would I take them here the morning after a night out for comfort food?  You betcha.  Would I go here myself when I'm tired of exotic foods and just want a damn sandwich?In a heartbeat."	neutral
"John's has the most delish corned beef hash in town!  Yeah, the coffee mugs have lipstick stains and the forks aren't the cleanest, but places like these are called ""greasy spoons"" for a reason.  In the words of Bart Simpson, ""This ain't the Ritz.""Their staff is super friendly.  You never need to ask for coffee refills.  And they have the best, most yummy coffee creamer!  Not hazelnut, Carmel macchiato or anything frou frou.  Just a very enjoyable cup 'o joe!!"	good
"This is the worst dining experience I've ever experienced in all my years. It is also the weirdest dining experience I have experienced in all my years...So I've driven by quite a few times and it struck me as a place the locals go when they've had one too many or maybe a place some of the locals frequent for a weekend hangover cure. To preface this, I'm under the impression that things were going through a change on this first and last visit here. There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the ""chef"" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well. So, anyhow, the story:Two adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal. Let's order!So the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles. Each meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. The soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they ""of the dayified"" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.Spaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. The roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.While that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the ""chef"" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the ""sauce"" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. The ""chef"" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it ""Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles""!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. I sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. The waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. She asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). So we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......So I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery. Losing it to say the least. I felt bad at first but then she started to smack the register each time a button press was unsuccessful....kinda in a way when you first find out your girl is a little bit kinky but you aren't quite sure what that means."	bad
John's Diner is your typical family diner,  that is inexpensive with good tasting food.  And it's  a REAL American classic diner!  Also, I would much rather support an affordable, good quality locally owned and run  'mom and pop' restaurant, instead of those overrated and rapaciously expensive national chains.	good
I love diners. I love breakfast food. I love independently owned ANYTHING. In spite of John's Diner having all of these ingredients, it proved to be the perfect storm for one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my dining life. I HATE to have to write this review, but I was so appalled that people like this place I had to protest. It was filthy (I got a coffee mug with hot-pink lipstick caked on it), outdated, muggy, falling apart, the coffee was weak and the food was cheap - in quality and price. You say no-frills. I say the setting of a horror movie right before everyone gets murdered. I left with a new desperation to take a shower. I'm so sorry, I wanted to like it. Save yourself the discomfort and visit the real no-frills diners of lakewood: The Place to Be and The Coffee Pot.	bad
I come here often. When I lived in Virginia I would come to John's diner whenever I visited my mother. You say greasy?  Then you never ate Southern food which is simple boiled or baked anything loaded with grease and/or sugar and/or salt.  John's seemed then and does now like Cleveland diner food my dad ate when he worked for the railroad. Western sandwiches, hot roast pork on white bread with mashed potatoes and gravy, lemon meringue pie and sausage with eggs and home fries. No grits please. The fish fry every Fridays beats any I have had to line up for in a church basement during lent. Cleveland has lost many diners such as Ruthie's and Moe's while others have glamorized such as the Clifton Diner. Thanks to whoever is keeping John's going with the same food and the simple interior and the same diner prices. Maybe lipstick on a pig fools some people but the rest of us knows a diner is a diner is a diner.	good
I've heard this place is amazing, but unfortunately had one of the worst dining experiences of my life. We stopped in for dinner and were the only customers in the place. They were out of the specials that were hand-written on a paper in our menus. We heard the cook complaining about how he was tired of serving terrible food. We had chicken noodle soup with no chicken in it. Food was nearly inedible. I'd be willing to try this place for breakfast, but will never be back for lunch or dinner.	bad
"In the midst of a cozy town is a cozy diner. This is a no frills place. Piles of food flying off the grill straight to the hungry locals.Hungry? Try the corn beef hash, this mountain of tender beef and potatoes, topped off with a crown of eggs, will fill you up for cheap.Coffee is hot, service is ornery, food is awesome. One star off for the facilities, they are definitely showing the age, and it bugged me a bit that the air vents were ""fuzzy""."	good
"So my girlfriend and I walked into this... ""establishment."" We took a seat at the only available spot on the bar. The employee dynamic was miserable at best. They were arguing with each other in front of the customers, suggesting that they all hate each other. I watched a woman give the customer the wrong change... Probably because their cash register is from the 1920s. The younger of the three women was yelling into the kitchen ""I'm not going to serve fatty bacon. Get your shit together."" I left before they even had a chance to take my order (which was easily 10 minutes after I sat down). I will never be coming back again. It looks like it's not just the chef that needs to get his shit together...."	bad
Breakfast wasn't too good here , bacon kinda in edible , but the people working were really nice , my bf loved his omelette but I just didn't like mine :( my potatoe hash was so oily I mean like pizza oily .. :/	bad
The boyfriend and I ate here last year and want to go back but due to the  cash only policy, we forget about the place often , which is a shame.  Good food and you get more than you pay for.	neutral
My boyfriend and I have been here a total of three times within the last 2 months. The first two times, the food was excellent, service even better. Unfortunately they only accept cash, but that's never held us back from a genuine home cooked meal.The third time, however, wasn't the best experience. The service was prompt, friendly as ever. The food was exceptional. The omlettes were 5 bucks and came with toast. We both added hash browns for $1.25. I got coffee and orange juice. He got lemonade and $2 stuffed grape leaves (which were the worst we've ever had.) They were different, not sour, didn't taste fresh at all. Anyways, we've always loved the exceptionally low prices, especially for the quality of food here. Coffee was awesome and before I could even think about getting another cup, I noticed it was already full. They must have charged us for EVERY refill, including coffee. Because our total was $28 and some change. Most of the refills were filled without asking for them. I could barely read the receipt and the prices didn't seem accurate.I'll definitely go back for breakfast again. I'll stay away from the grape leaves, because hey, it's a DINER, I can't really be mad. However, I WILL watch the prices and be cautious about refills. Overall, friendly breakfast spot in Lakewood.	good
An old time diner with lots of character, but not much attention is paid to the food. Cheap quick fuel us the reason to eat here. I just with the food was even a little better.  Nice staff, though.	bad
I love this place. Do not walk in expecting to be amazed. I guess you just need to wrap your head around exactly what John's Diner really is. Yes, there are lipstick stains on the cups from time to time, and yes, much of the menu is crossed out and rewritten in pen. The place is pushing 80 according to review from a newspaper hanging on the wall. You get what you pay for in this case, but it is charming if you are in the right mindset. It's fun.DO NOT order dinner food, it will be gross. They serve breakfast all day, and that is what they know how to do.Also: Their home fries are heavenly. :)	good
This was the absolute most disgusting food i ever attempted to eat in my life. I would not feed this food to my dog or a stray one on the verge of death for that matter. The coffee was cold, the water had a stench and an after taste, the soup was cold but i was able to choke it down. The food was rotten! The steak which i didnt expect to be the greatest smelled rotten and tastes sour, the gravy was old lumpy and foul. I have never once went to an establishment order 4 different menu items and everyone take 2 bites get sick to their stomach and not eat. The fact that the waitress took 4 plates not even touched filled with food back and not question was beyond me. We all got sick from our 2 tasting bites and i am probably going to call the health department. I didnt even want to give this place 1 star. I would rather eat the scraps thrown into a dumpster  from a gas station then to ever go to this place again	bad
1 star .. for 1 word = GROSS this entire place is filthy .. dusty .. sticky .. & it smells horrible	bad
"The only reason I did not give this place a single star is because I appreciate its history in the area and building itself is like eating in a time machine. However, the food here is just not good...and yes I have only ordered breakfast. My eggs were undercooked as was my bacon. Additionally, my coffee cup had lipstick stains on it. In the words of Dr. Evil ""That's just gross."" If you want to go to a real Diner in Cleveland where you can actually order anything on the menu and expect an awesome meal...Go to George's Kitchen!!!"	bad
This is an awesome plan for a fun night at the ballpark. We buy the cheapest seats possible, and stay here to watch the game. Compared to the other food at the ballpark, this is a bargain, especially when you can save on tickets.	good
En entrée les acras et les ailes de poulet sont incontournables. Pour le repas principal il faut essayer le ti-boeuf! La sauce est épicée à point et le boeuf tendre. J'ai jamais été capable de me rendre au dessert, les portions sont généreuses!	good
Nice resto, decent food. I tried the creole spring roll, the jerk chicken and the goat. Tasty and doesnt break the bank.	good
Petit resto créole bien sympa avec ambiance / musique des îles et tableaux aux murs. Le service était courtois et la nourriture délicieuse. Les dimanches y'a des groupes de musiques. Essayez !	good
Breakfast for lunch and lunch for late breakfast....my kinda place!! From salads, sandwiches to bagels....I love it on weekends to sit outside when I have time to lounge. I love that I can bring Max to sit outside with me!Casual, clean and yummy!	good
this kashman's is closed - as of Sunday June 20, 2010Their summit location is still OPEN - however, this is a little farewell to the Pinnacle Peak location.What used to be my favourite deli turned into a nasty neighbor. It's nothing personal, but really - they did everything to drive my business away, so when I say their doors closed, I was actually relieved because they left a sour taste in my mouth. While their food was decent, it was overpriced and I never got over just how cold and unwelcoming they were to not just me but everybody.I will not even bother to drive further north to visit their other location because really the farther away they are, the happier I am!	bad
Kashman's is the go-to deli of choice for my family.  My parents own a home between the two locations and when they are in town, we are frequent visitors to both.  I enjoy both breakfast and lunch at Kashman's.  I've never had a bad meal... omelets, oatmeal, bagels, sandwiches, salads, etc... it's all delicious!When I'm in need of a pick-me-up, I head to Kashman's.  Their chicken noodle soup combined with a power bagel and cream cheese does the job.  There is something about the combination of carbs, fluid, protein, and dairy; it's better than what my grandmother used to make me!  But don't take my word for it; go check it out yourself!	good
"Just realized that I wrote a review for the Kashman's location at the Summit, but not for this (Pinnacle Peak) location yet... and this is the one. turkey).  I love that it is full with veggies and the light balsamic dressing they use goes perfectly with it!  Other menu items that I order consistently are the omelettes (they do egg whites no problem), oatmeal, trifecta plate, turkey sandwich, and tuna melt.  The bagels are the best I've had in Arizona, and my friend DeDe swears by their matzah ball soup!I witnessed an interesting scenario when I was there today... a guy had bought lunch for his wife and came up to the register when I was paying and said: ""Excuse me... my wife changed her mind and does not like her cookie and she wants to exchange it for a blueberry muffin.""  Nancy, the owner, looked at him and apologetically said ""I'm sorry, sir - that is the cookie she chose and I cannot serve that cookie to anyone else now.  You can buy a blueberry muffin if you'd like.""This made me think two things: 1 - I'm glad they will not reserve food like that but 2 - perhaps they should have asked if the cookie was bad, etc... and maybe even done so much as to give them a muffin to make them happy?Anyways, that's my story for the day, but I have been and will continue to be a loyal Kashman's customer! I frequent!I am a regular customer at Kashman's and although I feel like it's kind of expensive, I love their food, so it's worth it to me!  Today I had the chopped farmers salad (no cheese "	good
Kashman's has great food but you really have to gear yourself up for the rude owner (artichoke lady) and some of the mean, crotchety ladies that work behind the counter. This is not a good place to place your order by phone. They're always nasty and short with you on the phone and then when you pick your order up, they get all bent out of shape because you have no place to stand and wait for your order. The guys and gals that bus are usually super efficient and very friendly and the food is above average. If you're looking for good food and a verbal lashing from the staff that work there, then Kashman's is your place to eat!!	neutral
Best breakfast in Scottsdale!  Bring your puppy	good
I love going to breakfast on weekends. I actually live for it and I've been going to Kashman's for about 4 years now. (Wow, has it really been that long!) After reading some of the reviews, yes - it is a little expensive for breakfast and yes- the food is normal breakfast food, but I love that it is a small little breakfast, brunch, lunch joint. I mostly love it because it is one of the few places that I know that welcomes pets! I feel so guilty some mornings getting up and leaving my little pooch that it is nice to have a place I can take him. Of course there is outdoor seating and it is a great way to start out your day. We usually see a lot of people come in after their morning hike. Some meals are big enough to share as well...although I don't.  :-)	good
I love all Jewish delis, especially ones located 30 seconds from my office door.	good
Once you figure out how this place works, it is a great place for a casual and tasty breakfast.  When you arrive, it is important to get a number for an open table before you order.  Also, the menu is fairly long, so it is best to get a paper copy and figure out what you want before getting in line.  I say this because even though the line may appear long, it moves FAST.  Yes, these people at Kashman's are quick and efficient, so you don't want to reach the counter undecided!  So far I have tried various omlettes (with bagel & fruit as the side items) and a breakfast bagelwich.  All have been great and arrive at the table quickly.  An added plus is the fresh-squeezed orange juice.  The seating inside can be tight, especially if there are peole waiting in line to order, but there is ample seating outside, most of which is either in the shade or under umbrellas.  One thing I really enjoy is that it is a dog-friendly place - they have bowls of ice water and bags of biscuits outside for our furry friends to enjoy.	good
kashman's tuna melt the best EVER. Have it on a cinnamon raisin bagel, I know it sounds nasty but it's delicious! Kashma's service is great and well worth the trip. Just remember they close by 3pm on the weekends and perhaps during the week as well.	good
I love Kashman's!  I've only been for breakfast, so I can only attest to the deliciousness of their eggs and potatoes.  They really make magic with their eggs here.  Way better than lots of other breakfast places can make 'em.  You also get a choice of bread with your breakfast, and I always get a bagel.  YUM. Oh and you can exchange your potatoes for fruit if you want to.  The staff is a little brash though.  They're a dash sarcastic and not all that pleasant, really.  But it doesn't bother me.  I just get my plate of tasty food, pay just a little (Kashman's is pretty cheap) and grab a table. You can also sit outside, but you'll be surrounded by dogs because Kashman's is definitely four-legged-friend-friendly.	good
Was visiting Scottsdale this weekend and wanted a local place for breakfast.  The food was pretty good but the service kind of sucked.  The woman taking the order in the restaurant came off as rude and not friendly at all.  If you can deal with that then no big deal.  Pretty good food for a reasonable price.	neutral
A fantastic breakfast/deli joint located in a strip mall (isn't everything here though?). Great selection of hot and cold sandwiches, scrambles, salads, and real bagels. My personal favorite: the Trifecta Salad Sampler, with a scoop of tuna salad, to die for egg salad, and chicken salad on a bed of romaine, with freshly sliced cucumber, avocado and tomato. Get in line, order, grab a table and enjoy the hustle and bustle atmosphere.	good
I love breakfast, and this place has decent food......BUT it is just very VERY normal food. Nothing unique or special and It is WAY overpriced. The wait times are also ridiculous. I don't like to wait 40 minutes for some average waffles.Don't believe the hype.	bad
I really am a fan of Kashman's Place, unfortunately I don't live in the neighborhood anymore or I'd probably make it a daily stop.  I swear that they have some of the best bagels that I've had in the valley- their jalapeno bagel hits the spot! So does their bagel sandwich for a quick on the run meal. I was also a big fan of and can recommend the Thanksgiving Cranberry Turkey and Sonoran Chicken sandwiches. Everything that I've had at either location was top-notch... if only they had a CenPho location.	good
I had high hopes for this place. It's only two strip malls away from my parents' hood (since I'm a visitor and didn't keep track of actual distances, and there are strip malls galore in this area, that's how I keep tabs on locations), and it's a Jewish-sounding deli! Sign me up...Three of us went for lunch and got sandwiches. My cousin, a 19-year-old macho man terrorizing much of the Phoenix female population currently, got the chicken salad sandwich. He liked it a lot. It was piled high with mayonnaisy (how in the heck should I spell that, sorry) looking chopped chicken. My boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich with cheese and roasted red peppers. He thought it was pretty good, but picked off the red peppers. I tried one, and could see why they wouldn't really fit with the rest -- really pungent tasting, would totally overwhelm and stand out from the other flavors. I got the half sandwich/half salad combo with the thanksgiving turkey sandwich (cranberry spread, yum) on whole wheat, house salad. Eh, just ok. Nothing special. This rates ok since it's convenient and serviceable, but really it's not the good Jewish deli I was hoping for, and the prices are pretty high for just a sandwich. I'd rather pick up fixings and make my own at this cost, which is what I did the next day.	neutral
Pinnacle Peak location now closed, just fyi!	neutral
Cute little place to go for breakfast on the weekend.  Food was good but I felt it to be a little over priced for a place that does not serve you.  In my opinion, I found Kashman's to be very overpriced for breakfast, and I found it to be the same quality as The Good Egg but way to over priced.	bad
Somewhat strangely, Kashman's has 2 locations off Scottsdale road within about 2 miles of each other.  This would make sense if the food was stellar and the prices were reasonable, but considering neither of those points are true this fact will remain a mystery...	neutral
Kashman's is North Scottsdale's best-kept open secret, something that many people living in the depths of Central Phoenix have never heard of and would never deign schlepping to for breakfast.  We became intimately familiar with it when we lived for nearly a year up in a  Grayhawk apartment, waiting for our condo renovation to be completed.  I love the egg dishes (try the Chicago omelet), the salads (Trifecta rocks), pastries made in-store (the black-and-whites are good, and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated, though, so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving) and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness (contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out).  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the owner's family to be quite friendly and quick to recognize regulars.Seating is sketchy during peak hours, although, for a relatively small strip-center establishment, there are a decent number of tables in and outside.  As a first-timer, remember to ask the wait staff at the door to give you a number corresponding with an open table.  You will need this when placing your order at the counter.  It can be difficult to peruse the large menu, so it may help to grab a paper copy before queuing up.	good
After being on our list for awhile, we finally made it out to Kashman's this week for breakfast (on a week day).  I was a little surprised when we got there, as I expected a sitdown restaurant, but instead it's an order at the counter and the food is brought out kind of place.  There was a TON of seating outside, and I remarked to my wife that Kashman's is probably the place to go on the weekend's once the temps cool down...We each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast.  There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk.  Coffee was good.  After a few minutes the food was served to us.  My french toast (stuffed w/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious.  It was one of the dishes where I have to tell my wife that if she wants a bite she better hurry up and get it while there is some to be had.  I finished the whole thing, no problem and wish the serving size had been a touch bigger.  The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it.  There was much honeydew and cantaloupe (both of which I dislike) and precious few slices of delicious strawberry.  I also had some of my wife's sandwich after she was done, and thought it was good, bagel was nice and warm still.  Kashman's get a solid four stars, and I'd probably go more often if it was a little more convenient for me, though I have a couple of relatives who I would consider making the drive out here for.	good
Craving fries and a coke. Took me 20 minutes to get through the drive thru. There was only 4 people in front of me. I had to pull up and wait for my drink. Then they forgot about me. I had to go inside and ask for it. What the hell. That's what I get for cheating on my diet.	bad
I would give one star but out of my last three visits this month, I had one good visit. My first visit, some hobo had a long conversation with me in the dining room about how he helps out the store by changing their trash and other things, which I'm sure is illegal, that visit my food was fresh though, which makes it worth it for me. Second visit the lady up front had her back to the counter while she was stocking which is fine, but the thing was she noticed I was there and NEVER acknowledged me. Another worker came up and asked her if she took my order than she turned around and looked at me than turned back around and took a drive thru order on her headset. I get people worry about their timers cause sometimes the management get upset if they're bad timers but dang, she totally neglected the front counter. Then I overheard them talking to a customer on drive thru about how they weren't accepting credit cards that night so I just walked out. I believe in second chances though so I came back a few weeks later and got perfect service from one of the night time managers, she was really tall and African American but I don't remember seeing her name, very nice lady. Food was again fresh, which was perfect. She made up for those first two times I ever visited this store.	bad
Worst McDonalds ever, ordered 4 mcchickins and 4 mcdoubles and a halfcut sweet tea with no ice. I got sweet tea with ice and only 3 mc chickens and 3 mcdoubles. And when we called back they said sorry an hung up	bad
Worst McD's in the entire state of Ohio. Never go here unless you want your order fucked up. Don't they have idiot proof ordering systems in there? I see them beeping and whirring away. Yet any time you come here, you don't get the right food. I should know better. Check the bag. There you go McDonald's, a new slogan for ya. CHECK THE BAG, BITCH. It's my fault for coming here. Oy vey, what a festering shithole of incompetence. I hope none of these people reproduce.	bad
It'a mcdonalds of course it's good. I give it a 3 to let people know that their drive-thru is the slowest I have ever been through.  time I go there. I hate it makes me so mad. They aren't even an option anymore because they are so slow. Tbell and rally's are super fast and good enough. Pick up the speed!!	neutral
Sat in the drive thru forever with no service. Even as cars lined up behind me the girl was only taking orders from the other lane. I finally gave up after the 3rd time she took the other lanes order over mine. This is by far the worst McDonald's in Cleveland if not the entire state	bad
"This is quite possibly the slowest McDonald's I've ever been to.  There's two drive thru lanes, but all this does it confuse the workers.  I've placed orders and by the time I reach the cashier she's forgotten it and I am often asked ""Which order was yours?"".  A few months ago I pulled in around 8am on a Sunday.  I was the only car in the drive thru but no one would answer the speaker.  Finally I drove around and went in to order.  I saw all of the employees standing in the back laughing and joking, no one was up at the counter.  When the counter employee finally saw me, she gave a huge sigh and acted like I was bothering her by being there.I have occasionally gone there around 4-5am and am not surprised to be waiting up to ten minutes for food.  No, that's not an exaggeration, I timed it at a few seconds over 10 minutes last trip (with only two cars ahead of me).  I know it's a McD's and I'm not expecting a five star dining experience but the wait times can get ridiculous.As far as the food goes, I haven't had an awful experiences.  They usually get my order right and the food is what you'd expect at a McD's, you're just going to wait an awful long time for it."	bad
I needed some food fast - and so opted for fast food!Ordered a Filet O' Fish sandwich and a bottle of water.Sandwich was made to order - hot and delicious! The cheese was melted just right, the tartar sauce was perfect, and the bun was soft and fresh.Hit the spot!	good
Worst mcdonalds store. All employees are not happy, not enthusiastic to work. The cashier was not even smiling. They should should just call in sick if they are not happy to work.	bad
I know this is mcdonalds, but I've been going to this one for 20 years and it is still by far the slowest service of any.  Late at night I think they only have one girl doing everything, taking the orders, collecting the money, cooking the food, and handing it out the window.  This is probably a management and staffing problem.  I go next door to rallys and I'm in and out in no time, and they are very friendly at rally's.  It's hit or miss at this mcdonalds.	bad
A friend and I ate here yesterday (5/13/09) and instantly fell in love.  The decor and table settings are extremely charming.The bistro is attached to an art gallery that features art and handcrafted pieces from local artists.My friend was interested in trying this place because of the fried green tomato BLT and she said that it did not disappoint! I ordered the turkey pita wrap with black eyed pea hummus (that I requested on the side) asiago french fries with a cucumber rittiata (sp?) dipping sauce.  My meal was delicious! In fact, I have been thinking about it all day.  All of the ingredients were fresh and extremely flavorful.  The hummus tasted like they had just prepared it as I ordered (and not took it out of a pre-made package).  The only gripe I had was that my turkey pita was served in a tortilla NOT a pita.For beverages, we both ordered the White Peach Iced Tea and it was very refreshing.I found the prices to be quite reasonable, not at all extravagant.  The price of my turkey wrap was $8.50 and the drink was $2.50. About the same as you would pay at any mid-level chain restaurant.I look forward to coming back and trying the fried green BLT and just about everything else on the menu.I highly recommend this place!	good
"Went to Maddi's for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious.  Started with a cup of good coffee and yummy fried green tomatoes.  Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally got to place our order.  I had the Portabello Wrap, which was well cooked, but over-mustard-ed.  The spicy mustard took over the sandwich and kind of killed my tastebuds a bit.  My dining partners had an omelet and gumbo (reviewed favorably), the fried green tomato BLT (which disappeared off the plate quickly enough to indicate its deliciousness) and the ""Birkdale Breakfast"" (which was on par, but not fantastic).  Assuming the wait for our waiter was not a regular thing, but a fluke of the day, I'd recommend this place for a delicious, ""new southern"" brunch."	good
Maddi's is a charming place for a casual but elegant lunch.  The food nods to Southern influence but does not require a fondness of or even familiarity with Southern cooking to appreciate it.	good
Maddi's is a cool, quirky find. All of the dinnerware and glassware are handmade, which really adds to the charm. We have been there many times for dinner, and brunch is also good. They also serve these delicious sweet potato muffins with both brunch and dinner that are to die for. However, we have noticed that Maddi's has declined over the last couple of months.  During our latest visit, the shrimp with grits was truly tasteless - there was no seasoning in the dish!  On two occasions, they have been unable to make martinis because they were out of alcohol.  What?!  The fried chicken, while still tasty, has shrunk in portion size.  Their soups are ALWAYS so thick it's like eating sludge.  However, we still go back because some dishes are consistently good (like the filet mignon or the fried green tomato sandwich).  If you want southern cooking, I would suggest giving Maddi's a try, just don't expect perfection.	neutral
A cool gallery that now has a bistro restaurant inside.  We had brunch there this past Sunday (7/6/08) and I fell in love with the place.The waiter was awesome.  No hurrying you for the next round of patrons.  Brunch was wonderful; well priced, good portions, and delicioius.As a bonus, we browsed the gallery next door after we ate.A definite must for any Charlottean looking for a new brunch spot.	good
"I am not really sure where to start on this one:  the service was mixed.  The lady waitresses were fantastic--they knew their stuff, and were kind and engaging.  The men of the house were awful in every sense: sassy, lazy, rude, bad servers and poor drink mixers. (When I pointed out that he had substituted 2 ingredients in a drink and was missing a third, he said ""yeah...we don't have the right stuff anymore.""  When I pointed to it on shelf behind him, he just walked away.)We have gone twice in the past week, and both times the food was pretty blah.  It was oversalted (and I LOVE salt!), overcooked, and a lot of good ideas just missed the mark.  For example, the mac and cheese was insanely soggy, the fried chicken was dry and the french toast with apples had tough, unpeeled apples inside, and already had the syrup poured on top when it arrived at the table. Who does that?I was excited to try this place after all the goods reviews, but after going twice and experiencing the same problems both times, I would say that they have either gotten lazy or had a change of staff.  Yes, the art can be a bit charming, but most of it was just plain tackiness disguised as cuteness.Highly NOT recommended, especially for the money."	bad
Very interesting space and nice.  Thought the food was a little over priced for what you got.  If you like southern cuisine you will like this place.	neutral
The service was extremely slow and the food wasn't even that great. Do not go here during your lunch break, or you will end up waiting about 1.5 hours total for your entire meal.	bad
Dear Sarah M.,Maddis is more a gift shop then an art gallery, but I think you missed the charm of the place because you were hung up on terminology.Sure the stuff is mass produced, but much of it is unique and exclusive.  I guess you would have to define art.  The jewelry, which is what takes me there at least 3 times a year (wife's Birthday, X-mas and Anniversary) is unique from artist who you will simply not find in the big boxes.Try going back with an open mind and look for a bit of whimsie.  You might be surprised how fun of an experience it really is.	good
"Really outstanding food....this is a restaurant first and gallery 2nd.  I found the ""art"" really tacky to be honest, but the cuisine is phenomenal.  I thought the menu lacked a little bit of creativity and selection, but the execution was perfect.  The fried chicken was absolutely perfect.  I would strongly recommend reservations for this place...they turn the tables over very slowly and it is a small restaurant."	good
Unfortunately, Maddi's at Birkdale has closed. It was very good. :(	good
Gross how can anyone serve food from a pig pen! I would not feed my dogs from this nasty so called restaurant!  With employees acting like it was high school running all over the manager! This place is a health hazard with the back having food everywhere! Amd mike the guy on the register giving food away to his friends making paying customers feel like he was doing us a favor for taking my order!!	bad
Don't get me wrong... I love Taco Bell.  This Taco Bell, not so much.It's hard to go anywhere when the people that work there obviously don't give a flip about their jobs or doing them well.  Have some pride in what you do even if it's not the end-all-be-all of your existence.  I will drive quickly past this Taco Bell to get to a better one.	bad
"I'm a definite fan of this Taco Bell, in fact... I secretly drive past one Taco Bell to go to this one.  I don't know if it is the newness of the building or the shopping complex it is in, but I've always had good experiences at this Taco Bell as opposed to the one closer to my house.  Everything is kept really clean and the inside is really modern.My one complaint is that in their attempt to make the interior ""modern"" the front register ended up with a curved metal railing that makes forming a line a bit confusing.  Not that there is ever a huge line here (which is also a plus), but it makes for a free for all if you happen to arrive at the same time as someone else."	good
Ah, Taco Bell.  This location is the closest to our house, yet for some reason it's probably the one we get to the least frequently.  They are also one of the nicer locations around, because it was built from the ground up.Rather than the old-style mission look, it's a rectangular building, with a modern look on the inside.  It's actually a nice place.  The staff has always been friendly, and service is usually quick as well.  They even have some high stools around some tables that make for convenient quick meals, rather than the typical fast-food style seating.  It's nice and appealing.Sweet Tea Report: What really sets this location apart is their sweet tea.  I don't know what it is, but this Taco Bell may have some of the best sweet tea out of any restaurant in Charlotte.  Definitely any fast food restaurant, but maybe any restaurant at all.  It's that good.  Unfortunately, you have to hit it right because depending on who makes it, the tea can be good or it can be bad.  Best of luck.I know, all you haters of Taco Bell are crying about the chicken places that have good sweet tea, but trust me on this one.  Taco Bell - or at least this taco bell - has some dang good sweet tea.  Farmer's BBQ has some good Peach Sweeet Tea, but for regular old sweet tea, I'd put this stuff up against just about anyone (if you get a good batch).And yes, I reviewed Taco Bell for #550.  How lame is that?	neutral
This place really does suck!It's kind of pointless having 2 sides to cook food on and you're only operating off of one with only one person working the line. Then on top of that because you're running one line with one person everything piles up and it takes forever to get your food when it should only take a few minutes at the most. Even better is the fact that they constantly mess up the orders over and over again. I mean sometimes I just want Taco Bell and sadly this is the closest one around my house unless I want to drive forever down the road. To top it off the sanitary in this place is horrible!! Constantly food all over the floor and your feet stick to it. Yet it never really looks like anyone cares to clean. Because of that I'm scared to even go into the bathrooms. If there was another Taco Bell around Id never go to this one again.	bad
This place is absolutely terrible! They got my order wrong I get home the Sierra mist had no syrup in it they wouldn't replace my drink and they forgot half of my order! I get home and call Taco Bell and they refuse to replace the food that they forgot to put in my bag unless I bring back the whole order! I explained to her this is not my fault like hell am I going to have food here and not eat it right now I'm hungry that is the point of drive-through and she hung up on me. I should've got her name so that I can talk shit about her on here. I will never go back to this place it is nothing but hood rats!	bad
Taco Bell is definitely my favorite fast food and out of all the locations that I go to I would have to say that this is my favorite the staff is always friendly and the managers always take their time to say hello	good
Want a lot of food for not a lot of money? Come here! My friend and I were looking for lunch around 2 O'clock and stumbled upon Indian Flavour. It is right in the downtown core and hard to miss with it's huge red, vertical sign. It's a fun looking room with colourful drapes and attentive service for a buffet. Come lunchtime, the best option is the buffet for 10 dollars and change. For two people, they brought us one naan bread, cut in half which is a bit stingy if you ask me. Anywho, to the buffet! The salad selection is pretty miniscule. I didn't even try anything on it because they looked a bit left out. The onion baji and fried other thing were cold and didn't have the crunchiness that is so welcome in food like this. I applaud the order of the line-up of food. Apart from dessert towards the beginning, it is a very logical setup for putting together my plate. The food is ok at best. Butter chicken's chicken has hard, unappetizing chunks of fat on the meat with bones and the lamb curry's lamb is also very fatty in an oily sauce. We ordered more naan bread and were not charged. I liked the eggplant dish and the spinach though it could have had a lot more of the advertised cheese. The rest, and we tried a lot more, I don't really remember which is telling. Despite this, we still went for two rounds of food, learning from our mistakes and left feeling very full. Meh.	bad
Hindsight is always 20/20, but it doesn't make it less true that Indian Flavour should never have moved out of its heavily trafficked Atrium location to it's dingy current second floor digs a mere block away. Visiting on a late afternoon (about the same time I always used to frequent when I was at Ryerson), I found the large dining room almost completely empty. The once incredibly pleasant servers were now sitting around a table, discussing something that was more important than greeting me. Once we established that I was going to forgo the lunch buffet ($9.99) and just have a combo of two curries ($6.99) to go, I was walked over to the buffet spread and dished out my meal. Although there were a fair number of both meat and veg options to choose from, the curries mostly looked inspired. The saag that I chose was rather bland and had only one lonely cube of paneer in it. The butter sauce (sans chicken) was a much better balance of spicy and sweet. While the server was visibly displeased and inconvenienced by their running out of pre-made naan at the buffet table, it must have been my my lucky day since the freshly prepared naan was definitely worth the wait. Now if business could just go back to booming, perhaps Indian Flavour could manage to churn out consistently quality food again.	bad
We should have known when we walked in to Indian Flavour at dinner time to find it deserted except for one lonely table by the window.  It's just early, we said, sitting down and ordering the buffet.  My water glass is spotted and stained.  My partner finds unidentified substance in his water.  Still, we shoulder on, convinced that we are getting a deal at $13.95 for dinner buffet.  Our hopes for the food were dashed.  Most of the selection at the buffet was uninspired.  Grease and salt were the prime ingredients as every dish was coated with oil and salty beyond belief.  It was so bad that I had to push myself to have a second plate, and didn't even bother to try their rice pudding dessert.  At least I didn't overeat at this buffet.  There are many good Indian buffets in town, and Indian Flavour is certainly not one of them.	bad
Well-meaning but understaffed. I got to check out the dinner buffet where one waitress had to take care of all of several tables. The kitchen was having a hard time keeping up with the food supplies. They ran out of Naan pretty frequently but the waitress had us in mind and always saved a few for us. The lamb curry was too slow coming that they just removed it from the buffet selection leaving nothing but chicken. The tandoori chicken was a rare sight too but the butter chicken was decent. As far as dessert goes, the Gulab Jamon was good but the ice cream was too hard to properly scoop, given that they didn't actually have an ice cream scoop. I'd say come only if you need to fix your Indian food craving.	bad
Great burger, especially for a Food Court.  First they have Great Burger, and the right balance between al-carte and signature burgers. Second, good friesThird, options, but not too many that would cause frustration.  Such as Salads, these are real salads, it you want to be a little be healthy.  Regular Burgers, Organic and Halal; Gluten free buns as options.	good
Almost $14 dollars for their 'best' burger' with a small serving of fries and soda.  If you've ever had a real hamburger you know this place is way overpriced compared to the amount and quality of food they serve.	bad
Had the big smoke burger, pouting and onion ringsBurger was deliciousGood portioning on the pouting and onion ringsFast friendly staff	good
I went there as I heard they serve Halal burgers...well I was there to check it out today. Firstly they charge about a $1.25 for a halal patty. They do have beef and chicken patty. We were two so we ordered one each. We ordered the Big smoke burger and Spicy chicken burger. Lets start with the taste, the beef tasted ok... I have had better but their chicken tasted good.  The patties were good but the bun was too thin to hold the burger together. Both burgers were cooked properly and were still juicy, they also put sauteed onions on top which help out as they put a tiny bit of lettuce leaf. The fries were to die for they tasted smokey and were very enjoyable. All in all its a decent joint to have a burger and enjoy some food.	neutral
Went here just to say I tried it, since I'd never been to one before and this is a new location.I just had a hamburger.They are very cheap with the condiments, all I had was mustard and ketchup on my burger and there was barely any on it. Luckily I waited until I was home to eat and just added more to my liking. McDonald's puts more on their burgers than this place did, and that's saying something!I was not asked how I would like it cooked and that is probably why it was ' well done' . I normally like my burgers medium to medium-well and this burger had no pink whatsoever. I did not get anything else during this visit because I knew I was going to eat at home. Fries don't normally travel well. I will go back again in the hopes that this was just an opening week glitch on the time they need to cook their burgers. Plus, I have to try their poutine at least once. :)	bad
"Oh man. This is such a disappointing review for me to write. I love Big Smoke Burger on Yonge Street. I had a pretty good Big Smoke Burger experience on King West. I was hoping that this closer-to-home Big Smoke location would at least be good, but it was not. Unfortunately I'm not going to have my Big Smoke cravings satisfied without having to drive to Toronto. So I order the spicy burger combo and I watch the dude slap my patty on the grill. So far so good. I then watch the grill continuously flare up. I really had to restrain myself from being a back-seat griller and shouting out, ""Hey, buddy, how about you try controlling those flare ups, please."" I didn't want to be one of those people so I said nothing. I also said nothing as I continued to watch my patty shrink ever so quickly because of all the flare ups. I continued to say nothing as the dude flipped my patty over and over again when what I really wanted to do was yell at the top of my lungs, ""Dude, that patty must be done by now with all the direct fire it's received. Pull it now!"" Just as the dude is about to pull my patty off the grill, the other guy says, ""It's a spicy,"" so the first guy puts my surely overcooked patty back on the grill and covers it with grilled onions to warm up the onions. They left that overcooked patty with the onions on the grill for another three minutes or so as my burger loving soul died a little more. Finally he pulled the patty.What did I end up with? A creosote covered charcoal briquette. Black on the outside, dry as MDF on the inside. I knew this was happening. I knew this was happening and I said nothing because I assumed people who are paid to cook burgers everyday know more than I and because I didn't want to be one of those people. This is what happens when you restrain yourself because you don't want to be one of those people. You end up with a dangerously  blackened (seriously dangerous, read the studies about blackened grill meats)  burger and a little of your soul dying as a good burger goes up in flames (literally!). I would have brought it back, but I was in a big rush and I didn't have time to watch them ruin another patty. The Big Smoke head office people need to get on this situation and do some remedial training for this crew. This is unacceptable. You can't serve people blackened, dried out patties. It doesn't taste pleasant and it's not safe to eat."	bad
Stopped At square one after work and noticed  they were Doing renovations in the food court. Decided to try something new and walked over to big smoke burger. The menu had a wide range of topping combinations but I settled for a regular cheese burger and side poutine  to see if they could impress me with the basics. My combo came up to 12 dollars with a fountain ginger ale.  I must admit I was impressed. There were Actually char marks on my burger and I could taste the smokey flavour. The ingredients tastes fresh and paired together nicely. I actually found for once in my life there was more burger than bun. I didn't have high expectations for my poutine but it was delicious.  They use real cheese curds and it tasted like a beef base gravy. I will definitely be back to try one of their more gourmet burgers and a side poutpout	good
Expensive but yummy. The burger patties are very juicy and tender.	good
I used to come here a lot when they first opened, ordering the classic chicken burger. It's pretty good. Expensive for a burger ($9) but it was freshly made in front of you. Last time I was here, i had the most unprofessional service. I waited 30 minutes for a burger that they forgot about. When I kept asking where my burger was they kept saying it was next (but they just put the chicken on the grill. After 30 minute and about 5-7 people getting their food ahead of me I asked for my money back. I couldn't wait longer, and had to return to work. They literally threw my money back at me and whipped the burger in the trash. All done by the manager. I will NEVER be back here after this experience.Maybe at another mall but not square one Food 4/5Management/Experience 0/5Price 2/5	bad
Ordered the organic burger because for some reason, I'm super into organic food this week. One of my weird weeks (I usually go healthy, unhealthy, Asian, salad and soup and only have one of those for the entire week).  Not sure why I do that.  Anywho, I digress.  The burger tasted good and had an okay bun - slighty soft, but it wasn't anything special.  As for the beef itself, it was juicy, but didn't have too much flavour.  I can say it's better than McDonald's and BK, but I think Lick's is better.  It was almost $11 for the burger and a ginger ale, which is kind of pricey.  However, I don't mind trying new things. Also, even though this was a fast food joint, the service was good.  They said it would take 7 minutes and being the nerd I am, I timed it and it took less than 4.  Love the fact that they give you a heads up.  Not bad burger, but not awesome.	neutral
Big smoke alright! Nothing special just expensive, better off going to mcds, burger king. Def more affordable & decent selection. Highly not recommended.	bad
Good, great poutine... Burger tastes like Burger King.	neutral
Probably the best Halal burger you can find in the city. Their fries are also great!	good
Hmmmm so after coming to square one for the first time this place definitely caught my eye! So second time going to square one I definitely came here! I got the classic* big smoke burger as recommended by the employee there. The fries here are so good! Reminded me of nyc fries but better! So I love a nice juicy burger that maintain shape for as long as it can haha. At first this burger maintained shape. Roughly 3 bites till finish it becomes quite sloppy which is OK for me since the middle is all gone. The meat was amazing the bun was grilled, sweet onions, some kind of exotic cheese I don't know how to spell or remember and a tomato that didn't come out on first bite. Oh man it was quite a nice burger haha. Definitely will come back to try another!	good
Great burger - have tried organic and lamb.  Great fries.  I'm impatient but found them well organized and wait wasn't too long.  Would eat more often, however, only downside is it is in Square One so cannot drive up and take out - have to eat there.  They should open up an outside location in Mississauga.  We need more quality gourmet burger places/options.	good
I really enjoy this place and it is my favorite of the chain burgers. Never had anything but a delicious juicy patty made the way I want. My only complaint is the price; $10 for a 4oz cheeseburher and a root beer or $15 for a combo is crazy but then again everywhere seems to be raising their prices lately so I guess it's to be expected.  Would be nice of they offered some low cost specials. The fries are good and thick, but the onion rings had too much seasoning and I found it hard to eat more than a couple.  Still though, I can appreciate the fresh patties(taste like my old man used to make on the bbq, but none of the swearing when the propane runs out) and that keeps me coming back	good
The only reason why big smoke deserves 4 stars is because of their poutine. Absolutely AMAZING & DELICIOUS. I used to go to south st. For their poutines but glad I stopped going there because big smokes' poutines are 10x better mainly for 2 reasons: 1. Bigger size and cheaper than south st. Their small at B.S is like eating a large at south street for a dollar less. Awesome! :)2. They give you more cheese curds without having to ask. ( who doesn't love cheese :p) As for their burgers... Well they are not the greatest. They taste like a boxed burger but with the price of a gourmet burger. Umm no thanks. I prefer south street..	good
"Big Smoke made big promises, and the resounding opinion from me was... ""It's alright, I guess.""I'll save my opinion/review of the Square One revitalized food court (spoiler: it's amazing) for another time, but I did want to comment on Big Smoke, as I visited the mall recently and stopped here for a bite with a friend.I had been meaning to visit this place for a while, but never had a chance (and the time to actually sit down and enjoy a meal) until recently. When I stepped into line - the longest in the food court, I might add - I was expecting quality that was out-of-this-world. Maybe the fault lies with me for wanting too much.What I got was... decent, but not worth the experience. After waiting in line, a friendly server took my order, and I was a bit surprised that it costs an extra $4 just to get a drink. Add to that disinterested cooks and people who were behind me in line getting their food before me (always a sticking point), and you can see that I wasn't starting off on the best foot.The signature Big Smoke burger I had was okay, but considering the price (something like $13 after tax for the combo), it's past the point where I consider it to be acceptable value for the money. The fancy ingredients they listed out in the menu didn't really amount to much for me, taste-wise. I was more impressed by the frosty mug they gave to me for my soft drink, and that was the high point of the experience.Probably wouldn't come back again."	neutral
The beef burger is really satisfying and the toppings have always been fresh, but BSB is definitely more expensive than burger joints of similar quality. The main advantage here is the convenience of the location (in Square One). Classic 6oz beef burger (not combo) is $6.79 - you choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, jalapeños, pickles, red onion, tomato, lettuce. Switching to Halal costs $1.49 - I really, really appreciate the option but this is steep for Mississauga when there are options like Burger Factory and On The Bun. BSB has some good signature toppings like sautéed mushrooms and carmelized onions for a surcharge. Hoping they bring back goat cheese and feta cheese!	neutral
Took my wife to Square One for some shopping and after an hour or so we were both getting hungry so headed down to the food court area...I mentioned to her i wanted to try out the newly opened Big Smoke Burger and she was also up to trying it out..we ordered two cheeseburger combos. You pretty much get to see your burger get grilled from a fresh meat patty and onto the grill while you are waiting..the focus here is using fresh products which was also reflected in the condiments that went onto the burger..our combo  also came with a nice helping of fries that were pretty tasty.We really loved the smokey flavour of our cheese burgers along with the fresh bun - the combo is pretty filling with fries but both wife and i were able to finish our plates.Overall, service was very good from cashier to picking up the food , and  price was good value for a premium burger - our 2 combos with two cokes came to around $ 24 and change.! Will come back next time with our kids and try some different menu items.	good
I had a a blue burger with organic patty to satisfy a craving for a burger with blue cheese. The burger was served with a somewhat cold bun (aren't they supposed to toast or warm the bun on the grill?). This really ruined the meal. Also, the meat wasn't as juicy as I remembered it. I felt I had a better burger at A&W. Will not be coming back here.	bad
My girlfriend and I love burgers and often resort to a good burger joint for comfort food. To our surprise, the Big Smoke Burger turned out to be quite tasty!We ordered the spicy burger which had sautéed onions, lettuce,  tomato and spicy mayo. Overall, the burger was moist and had a lot of flavor. We also turned this into a combo with a poutine and a drink and to our surprise, the poutine was also amazing. Great flavor with the gravy, thick cut fries and actual cheese curds! Unfortunately, the only down fall with the Big Smoke Burger was the cost. After all said and done: a quaint sized burger, poutine and drink came up to a grand total of $15, hence the rating of 4 out of 5. Otherwise, if the price was a little more reasonable, it would be a perfect rating.	good
Very friendly, helpful and the place was very clean. Prices are fair and I will definitely be back	good
"Brand new food business!  They make you a pizza, you take it home and bake it.  It's a create your own pizza place...  As their name goes  Papa Murphy's ""Take N Bake!"""	good
Love Papa Murphy's, but this location has an issue with the dough. It never rises. Papa Murphy's is famous for the dough. We have tried the.deep dish, stuffed and regular. Same problem. Such a shame because the rest of the ingredients are fresh and the staff are polite and friendly. Please fix your dough.	neutral
I didn't care for this pizza. The sauce is gross and the crust taste like Bisquik.  It's also kind of on the expensive side for having to take it home and bake it yourself.  I would rather pay the same price for an already cooked pizza.  The cinnamon dessert was good though.  I will not be going back.  This pizza hurt my stomach.  I will stay with RKidds down the street.	bad
HORRENDOUS customer service. Kristi was rude from the moment I walked in the door. I used to eat Papa Murphys weekly...after today I definitely will not be returning.	bad
Great deals! Sign up for text deals! Very cool!The girls were super nice!Love this concept. Pizza was yummy of course!	good
It's always a pleasure to walk in and be greeted with a smile and over-all good service!  Extensive menus and yummy pizzas are a plus.	good
Wings at this location after just bad.  They  taste like frozen wind from Walmart.  For a wing joint that cagers to the wing connoisseur, theit wind are the worstDo yourself a favor and go one block north on Jane St to St. Louis Bar and grill.  These wings are way better.Try even Buffalo Wild Wing just down the street.Just don't waste your money here.	bad
"In the words of today's teenager: 'I can't even.' After a fail attempt at getting a table at Marcello's, my boyfriend's sister suggested Wild Wing as an alternative given it was within the same plaza. With a communal indifference to the dinner option after our blunder, we agreed. The warning sign should have been how empty the restaurant was with a single patron sitting at the back of the restaurant working vigilantly on her computer and nursing a beer.  The lone waitress didn't greet us, didn't nod an acknowledgment and didn't seem to give a rat's that we were there. Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over. 10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting. Now, it's a no brainer: you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related. However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option. So, you can imagine the gut sinking feeling when the waitress reappeared 15 minutes later and she advised they were out of the boneless option. (Why it would take 15 minutes to flip through the three page menu, [one of which consists of wing flavours to decide] in order for you to draw the conclusion that A: You want chicken. B: You want it in some variety, or C: You like to play on the wild side (see what I did there?) and stray away from the traditional by getting a burger.) (You daredevil, you.)  Fine: I will meet your lack of boneless option and go with the chicken fingers. I should have taken the no boneless option as my third warning to run while I still I had a chance. Upon the waitresses arrival, we were greeted by plastic plates (why on earth any establishment would be serving their meals on plastic plates purchased at their local Dollarama is absolutely BEYOND ME) and quite possibly the soggiest, stalest tasting nachos. The salsa tasted rancid, and the lettuce was wilted. Upon the arrival of my entree I encountered what appeared to look like it had come straight out of a Hungry Man frozen dinner... the chicken fingers smelled off... like they'd been sitting in the back of the fridge. I was feeling ballsy, so I took a bite... I wasn't convinced. My boyfriend's GarPar chicken wings followed suit, and they were bland tasting.20 minutes later when our waitress arrived to do a very delayed quality control check, she asked how everything was tasting. I explained to her the lack lustre experience I was having with my meal, she stared at me blankly as she asked me several times to describe how they tasted...they tasted freezer burned...they tasted off...how many other ways did I need to find in order to describe this? ""Do you want another meal made?"" No, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible...instead I asked for some more sour cream...I should have anticipated that upon her return, the sour cream would be extremely watery and very off in texture. An elderly couple helplessly attempted to flag down our waitress whom she ignored several times before the poor woman with an evident bad hip hobbled over to her requesting her attention. Given the destitute of people within the restaurant, it was easy enough to hear the woman explain that her chicken...well...it didn't taste like chicken. The waitress feigned surprise before asking: ""Does it taste like freezer burn?"" ""Yes!""FACE PALM. When my boyfriend went up to settle the bill, he was started to find my meal on the bill. Upon asking if she could do something with it given my circumstances, she sighed heavily and said she'd have to consult with the kitchen staff. She returned two minutes later and said: ""I can give you 15% off."" My boyfriend now agitated by this response rebuttled that I hadn't even consumed even half of my meal."" ""Well, she ate the fries, right? I'll just charge her for those."" $4.99 on cardboard French fries later... and we were racing for the door with a mutual agreement to never return again. Wild Wing, there is a reason why a number of your establishments are closing, it's only a matter of time before you, your crappy chicken and plastic china at this location follow."	bad
Came here on a Tuesday for the wing special which was a pound and a half for the price of one pound ($12.99) with the purchase of any beverage. It came with your choice of single sauced chicken wings (breaded/unbreaded/boneless), fries, a dipping sauce (blue cheese, ranch, sourcream, dill), celery and carrot sticks. I ordered the blue moonshine which was a mix of blue cheese and bbq sauce. My brother got the country girl which came dressed with their my thai sauce and pineapple. Honestly, the food took a really long time to come out but we both agreed that it tasted it pretty good compared to other well known chicken wing places. Our server was very friendly and helpful who did periodically check up on us but never offered us any water to start. Instead we just got the drink we ordered for the special which was a ginger ale ($2.99/unlimited).You can definitely tell that this specific restaurant no longer anticipates for Tuesday wing eaters as the place is practically empty. The whole establishment just felt very run down and slow.Overall, I didn't have a horrible experience here but I also don't see myself coming back either.	neutral
I dont really eat chicken wings as a meal, its just not my thing so I got the lucha libre tacos and all I have to say is GROSS. They were bad,bad,bad. Under seasoned, small and the tortilla bread was horrible. I dont know what I expected but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. They were COLD. Our group was the only people in the place and we could never find our waitress she kept disappearing to somewhere into the back which is really unhelpful when we seem to the the only people in there for the entire time we were there. The food honestly is hard to explain how bad it was. I've had better food come from the freezer section at No-frills. I will not be returning nor will i return to any wild wing. The food and the service were both lacking.	bad
Food is not bad at all.  Especially Wings and its flies are good.  Wing is not small.  It's still juicy and I really like its sauce taste and choice.  The blue moonshine night cheese dipping for my daughter's fries is a smooth texture and just right flavour which even my wife loves that.  I think Wild Wing's wing has a quality on food in average.  Portion is ok compare to its price level.  They have kids menu and the portion is just right.Only thing I am not quite satisfy which I can tell is the service it provide with the price.  I mean the service from getting reception to table.  The waiter told us it is around 15 min but I have waited 25 to 30min but actually the place is not that full at that time.  Well, it is me and my son's birthday, so I don't want to ruin the time.   Wait time on the food is not fast but I am patient enough along with my smartphone.Place are big, clean but definitely a sport bar is quite noisy for family but good for a big group over 10.  Be sure you reserves for table otherwise you will be frustrated unless you want to sit in the bar side.I think I am one of the kindest about the reviews.  I cannot say Wild Wing is very bad in food, but service wise, it needs to be improved in order impress people to come back for a second visit.  Or unless they have a very good price or food quality or speciality, otherwise, it is even hard to impress a not-so-demand guy to come back a second time.	neutral
I came here on a Sunday night after failing to get a table at All Star Wings. It was empty when my group an I arrived, with only one table occupied. We all ordered wings and I liked that it came with fries. While we were waiting for our order, I started noticing a washroom/sulfur smell and everyone noticed it too. The smell was still there even as we were leaving. One other thing that bothered me was the washrooms were single washrooms but there was no lock on the door.The food was very lacklustre and the wings reminded me of frozen breaded wings you'd get at a grocery store. Overall, I would give the food one star and another star for the service. This place was dead for a reason and I definitely would not recommend this place at all.	bad
This place is a gem. We had friendly attentive service, food was fresh, place was clean. If you need to satisfy a pho craving... Go here. Parking lot looks a bit ghetto but don't let it defer you.	good
This is perhaps the closest pho restaurant to Port Credit. The place is nicely decorated and it's easy to get parking. The staff are friendly and the food comes out quickly. We tried pho, pad thai and a green curry - all delicious. This place is a really good find, the prices are reasonable and everything is fresh. I hope this place sticks around!	good
Happened to stumble upon this little quaint restaurant. We ordered Pho and since they recently opened, the owner gave us an appetizer of mango salad, plus We also got a 15% off our bill. The service was great! Food came quickly and was tasty. We'll go back.	good
Very good food for decent prices. The atmosphere is nice and peaceful too, don't be discouraged from the exterior. Although i wouldn't recommend ordering their shakes if u didn't being ur own straw because their straws are literally so thin, that ur drink will be undrinkable. We asked them for a thicker straw but they don't have. Kind of a joke if u ask me..	good
The food was very fresh and quite tasty. The mango salad was very nice, but lacked heat. It could have used a Thai bird chili. The Tom yum coconut chicken soup tasted okay but was a bit too sweet. It could have used more coconut milk as it was a little watery. It also had a lot of celery, which isn't traditional and didn't add anything to the flavour. The vermicelli with beef and lemongrass was very nice although it also didn't need the celery. The restaurant and washrooms were clean, bright and very pleasant. The service was excellent and very friendly.	neutral
Direkt neben dem Stern hat vor einiger zeit ein neuer, größerer dönerladen aufgemacht. Dort war ich exakt einmal, und bin dann reumütig zum Stern zurückgekehrt. Leckerer döner und pide, freundliches und schnelles, personal (nicht so mürrisch wie bei manch anderem dönerladen). Falls man mal auf sein essen warten muss, liegen zeitschriften zum lesen aus. Tadellos!	good
Never fill the cups all the way up and unless you ask for extra toppings you get hardly any. Don't waste your time! Drive the extra distance to a different DQ!!	bad
My husband and I got one cookie dough blizzard and one role blizzard. Previously we had a couple nice blizzards here but this second time was awful. There were hardly any topping (not as bad as the worst blizzard ever at the other Gilbert Rd. but 2nd worst)... The drive through line was looooong and sloooow. And ultimately not worth the wait. So far one hit and one miss. Unfortunatley for us that (including Gilbert Rd) DQ as a whole is more miss than hit and no more DQ for us...	bad
"We were not able to find the location and when we called the, ""manager in charge"" told us she didn't know where she was located at hung up the phone. Several call backs later we were told they were they were located near different stores where they were not at.  Finally, we asked asked for a General Manager, only to be told he is out of town. There is no-one else to speak to besides the 16 year old acting manager who doesn't know where she is located at. Would not recommend this location if you want good customer service!!"	bad
5pm on a Monday, 2 young girls working with zero smiling, zero eye contact, not kind at all. Very slow moving, acting like they hate life! Ordered a large pina colada regular and it has zero flavor. So the whole trip was a waste.	bad
I like to get the strawberry julius here about twice month - it has been consistently good every time.  When they are busy the line still moves quickly.	good
Love the deal for ice cream cones and that is what I have tried so far. I will come back to try food items.	good
The staff was very friendly greeted us coming in  I had the strawberry cheesecake blizzard and my cousin had the oreo blizzard i will definitely return to this location	good
If you're going for ice cream or a Julius .. you are probably ok ... but in my view .. not the place to grab a quick lunch.  Ordered BLT ... and the meat tasted old.  All food selections are pretty unhealthy.  No salad to substitute for chips... as with McDonald's, Wendy's, Arby's, or Chick Filet.   Pretty sub-par sandwich.  Nothing to get excited about ... and as long as I don't get sick .. I guess I'm ok ... just not going back.  For the money ... Chipotle is probably a better, fresher, and healthier choice (depending upon what you choose) .. in the San Tan mall ...or even Paradise Bakery.	bad
Staff are rude and did a poor job on the order. We'll drive the extra mile to go to another one. Our advice is to STAY AWAY.	bad
Bivy is truly a gem in the Toronto brunch scene. I used to live a block away from Bivy and it literally was one of my top highlights of living in that neighbourhood. It is so good!First and foremost - I really dislike brunch. Something about paying $20 for a couple of eggs and potatoes drives me nuts. But Bivy was a game-changer for me when I discovered it 2 years ago - and still insist on travelling on the weekends to go back there today! Do yourself a favour and go.- Intimate but not crowded- Rarely a wait- Generous portion sizes- I almost always order the Ploughman Platter, but have ordered their salads in the past (Farmer Salad) and was not disappointed- I bring all my friends and guests here - many of whom ordered their Croque Monsier and raved about this plate- Great pricesYou won't regret it.Update:I'm not sure what happened on a recent Saturday brunch visit (March 2016). I had talked up this place to a couple of girlfriends, and convinced them to trek a little farther outside of our usual stomping grounds to meet at Bivy. Holy moly. Everything I've known about this place was flipped upside down.- Unbearably cold in the space. Teeth chattering.- My beloved Ploughman Platter that has been consistent for years came out so different than usual. No pate/terrine, flimsy toast, canned(?) sliced ridged pickles - what happened here!?- My friend's Croque Monsieur (also a usual fan fave) was so saltyService was also slow and unattentive this afternoon.I really hope this was an off day for them. I usually see the gentleman who I believe owns the restaurant working in the kitchen, and he wasn't there this day. Coincidence?	good
This is the most unassuming, underrated, unsung hero in the Dundas West strip. I never meet anyone who's heard of it or has been to it but I bring people anytime I need a good brunch or lunch. The chicken salad is packed with great stuff and so reasonably priced, the omelettes are always perfect, and the one time I came for dinner I had the jerk mussels which were excellent! It's so inexpensive and so delicious, the only thing I'm nervous about is that everyone is going to catch on and I'll have to wait to get a seat.	good
The brunch is one of the best, and most affordable in the city. You rarely have to wait for a table and the service is good. That makes Bivy a real gem in the often over-priced, over-hyped Toronto restaurant scene. Everything on the brunch menu is great but I would highlight the Croque, The Farcou (original version), the Tartiflette and the french toast. Their potato salad and green salads are always fresh and delicious. I'm told the coffee is excellent ( I'm a tea drinker - their selection is good).I have sampled the dinner menu much less but the pulled pork sandwich is good - excellent flavour - and the frites are great. Excellent value, excellent food and a lovely atmosphere.	good
"BIVY is one of my absolute favourite restaurants. The space is cheery and bright during the daytime and smooth and romantic in the evening for their new dinner menu. I've been a faithful daytime attendant for weekend brunch, weekday lunch, a coffee and a pastry-fuelled afternoon of work... I've always absolutely loved my experiences with their unbelievably friendly and attentive staff and their delicious food.They hit it out of the park with their farçous (spinach pancakes) and omelettes, both of which I keep coming back to. I've also loved their tartiflette (potato/cheese tart) and the healthy bites I've had sharing plates of the kravitz, the ploughman, the gravlax... Basically I'm a well-meaning mooch, and my partner and I regularly wind up splitting our plates because everything is so tempting. Most of their meals come with a perfectly composed salad with mixed greens, thinly sliced radishes and a beautifully light vinaigrette and then their phenomenal potato salad...  Possibly the best I've ever had. It's definitely a step up from something you'd have at a BBQ. Everything is just really delicately balanced and flavoured just right.Since they just launched their dinner menu, I've only tried it once, but it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Finding a decent and well-priced steak is a real difficult task in Toronto, but BIVY has it down. Their entrecôte steak frites comes with a grilled 10 oz rib eye prepared at a perfect medium rare as requested and covered in an understated herbed butter, fries that are seasoned just right and done to the perfect crisp without being overcooked and, of course, that beautiful simple salad. For $18.95! Pair it with one of their well-priced glasses of wine and you have the perfect date night. We'll be back again soon, probably tacking on an order of mussels to start since they look SO good.I know I'm just gushing at this point. I just really love this place and it's the perfect local spot. It's equal parts cafe, brunch/lunch stop and great dinner option. A lot of restaurants wouldn't be able to juggle all those identities, but BIVY is great at doing simple, delicious food and providing a versatile ambiance with great service. I'm so happy to live near by. The only problem is that I'm constantly tempted to say ""Let's just go to BIVY"" instead of, you know, cooking at home and not blowing my paycheque on daily jaunts to my favourite neighbourhood spot."	good
Bivy is a contemporary Canadian brunch spot with a French influence. Upon entering during the day, the restaurant gives a relaxing vibe for customers to sit down and enjoy their meal or coffee. Bivy has brunch and dinner hours, which you could come in for dinner from Tuesday through Saturday. They close from 4-5 PM during those days to prepare for the evening. Bivy serves interesting dishes, such as their French spinach pancakes and their different version of the French toast (which is more of a bread pudding).The beer served are sourced locally from Ontario. The alcoholic drinks consists of beer on tap and basic cocktails. To give back to their customers, Bivy has a policy of giving one free cup of coffee to a customer everyday. This is an awesome policy and a great way to brighten up someone's day!I tried their Mochaccino, which is their version of a mocha and I believe cappuccino combined. It has a nutty taste to it so it is great if you like that flavour. Overall, I think Bivy is a nice spot to go to for a quick brunch with friends or your significant other during the week.	neutral
Good portion sizes and yummy food. This is a reliable lunch/brunch spot that is a very relaxing place to hang around during the weekdays. I almost always get the spinach pancakes with house smoked salmon (weekends) or bacon (weekdays). As well, delicious cookies, and shortbreads are only 3 for $1.50.	good
One of my new favourite joints in the west end. Came for a lunch meeting without any reservations. Ordered the Countryside Farçous: French spinach pancakes served with Montreal Smoked meat, mixed greens & potato salad 12.95 (9/10). These pancakes were Gluten free baby. Not the traditional idea of a fluffy pancake, rather more of a lightly fried spinach and egg crepe. The smoked meat served with the pancake was a bit too salty, but was easily balanced out with the fresh mixed greens and potato salad. My lunch companions ordered the Salads with Bivy dressing 10.75 - A generous portion of fresh greens and a balanced serving of toppings. Something I will definitely try on the next visit. Rating Summary: Food: 9/10 - Overall excellent food, meat was a tad too salty.Atmosphere: 10/10 - Perfect spot for a lunch meeting. Modern décor, spacious, plenty of seating and music volume wasn't overbearing.  Service: 8/10 - Water service needs improvement. Friendly staff. Quick service for a lunch hour. Can't wait to come back. Note: Bivy only takes cash or debit cards.	good
I don't live in the neighbourhood anymore, but when I did, I went to Bivy multiple times for brunch and was never disappointed. It's a little brunch place that is really chill, the menu is small and simple and the food is great. I've had their omelette and their quiche and was not always happy with my choice. Good portion but not a gigantic plate of food that would make me feel sick for the rest of the day. Their prices are fair. No line, no loud music, no pretentious waiter. My kind of place.	good
So, nobody knows this place is now open for dinners, apparently... Which is better for me because I'll be hitting this place weekends on the regular. No wait, great service, delish food and the place all to yourself. ...I have a feeling I'm going to be regretting writing this review very soon.	good
The food is delicious and always so fresh. It's not heavy or greasy, just good quality ingredients. This place is always packed for lunch but the recently JUST OPENED FOR DINNER!!! Tuesday thru Sun they are open until 9:30pm. I love this little french inspired bistro and hope it stays open. Give it a try and spread the word! Also, excellent wine selection! The Parisian owner Pascal is lovely and has a lot of pride and love when it comes to his food.	good
Great find! Wandered in for lunch as there aren't many options in the neighborhood. Had a wonderful open faced tuna sandwich served with lots of fresh salad. My bf had the Farcous which was also excellent. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. Planning to go back to try their home-cured salmon!	good
This is a great place. The food is really good but what impressed me the most were the prices.  It is cheaper than Swiss Chalet (aka Swiss Pigeon) and like 10x better quality.  I had duck confit and my father had the Ribs, both were great and cheap.	good
"Discovered this place from my ""Indie Coffee Passport"". Went for a morning coffee, but decided to stay for breakfast.Ordered the ""Baked French toast"", WOW it was very good.Nice small place, quite, good food and friendly services.I would go back!"	good
My wife and I recently moved into the area and Bivy happens to be just down the street. As we saw they were now serving dinner we wanted to give it a try. Overall we were shocked by how good the food and service were from the salad to the mussels and the duck confit. Best of all is the price which you would expect to pay double for. We go out to eat about once a week all over the west end and this was one of the best dinner experiences we have had in a while.	good
My partner and I took our moms here, as we had heard good things. We were not disappointed. Everything from the mains to the sides to the coffee were exceptional. The fresh goat cheese, the spinach pancakes, the salads, the quiche. Perfect portions and delicious!	good
Lovely flavors and friendly staff. Had the vegetarian spinach pancakes as well as a veggie sandwich - both with the amazing potato salad on the side.	good
Second time there for Brunch, delicious. My friend had the brisket and I had the croque monsieur, she loved hers and wanted mine too. The croque was delicious and we both agreed it was one up on Bonjour Brioche - which has held this accolade for some time! I do suggest you try it. The other thing I have here is the Farmers Salad which just makes me feel happy and well fed.	good
Fresh food from whole ingredients, consistently prepared well.  Great coffee.  Reasonable prices.    Friendly, unpretentious service.  Been here many times, and it's always been good.  What else do you want?	good
Music by Monkees!! Away from hustle and bustle. Great food and good coffee awesome service what else can you ask for.	good
3.5 Stars.Sometimes we like to do really good things, but at some point it ends up being too much; maybe we bite of more than we can chew.The Bivy is a good spot in Little Portugal, but there is A LOT going on in this place. They serve decent coffee--not the best, not the worst--, they serve brunch and dinner, and they have a liquor license, which gives them the opportunity to sell alcohol too. This leads to an unfocused attention on certain items they may want to do better, the coffee being one of them.I like the layout of the place. The tables and chairs seem to work well with the place and actually brighten the place up. The staff are very friendly and willing to serve everyone well.The place is a great place, but I get the feeling they are a little confused as to what they want to be known for. Is it a great coffee place? Is it a great brunch spot? Is it a great place to get a night cap? There isn't an identity here.Nonetheless, 3.5 stars for me because it exceeded a little bit of expectations, but could be more if they truly found their identity.That's it.	neutral
I've come here twice now. First for coffee/tea and a cookie. Second for brunch.The tea is higher quality than what you'd find at most cafes in the city - very fragrant and flavourful. The baked goods are excellent.Had the croque monsieur, farcou, and ploughman's breakfast. Weren't too interested in some of the offerings in the ploughman's breakfast but the farcou and croque monsieur were impeccable and well-priced. Perhaps the ploughman's is for more adventurous eaters.This was the first time I'd gone for brunch in ages where I didn't have to wait in a line for a table. What a refreshing change! Also, staff was SUPER friendly!	good
Initially the purpose of this trip was to get cappuccino from the Indie Coffee Passport (ICP) but once we saw the brunch menu we decided to to eat here as well. My friend decided to order a french toast and I went for Poire Helene since I am a sucker for pear desserts. For the ICP we both ordered a cappuccino. The service is decent here and we were checked on regularly and the server even shared her fav on the ICP. The food did take its time to arrive though even though the we went at off peak hours. The French Toast is a mini portion, it is quite good nonetheless. Raisin haters beware as they do use raisin bread. Poire Helene was just OK as I have had a lot better versions. On to the cappuccino Espresso: MildCrema': below averageMilk: Frothed OKThis is a very average attempt at a Cappuccino.I would say 2 stars and that's pushing it already.The decent food gives it a bump to 3. They did push their dinner and gave us a discount coupon for that.Cash and Debit Only!!	neutral
My first visit to Bivy was during the DuWest sidewalk sale. I went in when they were slammed and waited quite a while for a take out order. The wait was worth it. I had a house cured salmon sandwich and it was great. My wife and I just went for brunch today and I had the French pancakes with again their house cured salmon, a nice mixed green salad and potato salad, which I believe comes with every dish. My only suggestion would be some form of creme fresh or sour cream to compliment.Friendly service, and a nice atmosphere, complements your experience. I'll definitely return.	good
This is an elegant lunch joint a bit west of p|m Gallery.And our favourite place for an Americano on the Little Portugal strip.	good
Loved this place. A bit of a diamond in the rough of that area. Started with the Charcuterie to share amongst the three of us. Wonderful while chatting and sipping a wine. I thoroughly enjoyed my Salmon entrée but was able to share the steak that my wife had and would order that next time. The duck was also delicious and I enjoyed that as well. Service (by Patrick) was discreet and relaxed to fit the ambiance. Worth a trip to that part of town for food from a genuine French chef and owner Pascal.	good
Stopped into Bivy for a weekend dinner, and was adequately happy with the results. The interior is pretty much on par with most of the other restaurants that have popped up in this area in the last couple years, with reclaimed wood interiors with small candlelit tables. We started with the charcuterie and spicy devilled eggs to start. Both were tasty and appropriately priced, but the devilled eggs were admittedly not actually spicy. Still tasty, but adding a dusting of paprika is hardly spicy to me. Then as a second course we split an order of ribs, which were decent, but a little to overpowering in the citrus based acidity. As a main, I rounded out my meal with the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pulled pork was admittedly less acidic than the ribs and more savoury. The spinach in the sandwich was a nice addition but the tomato and mayo just made me realize the flavor of the pork isn't impressive enough if relying on additional sauces and juicy vegetables to affect its flavouring. In the end for 4 beers, the 2 apps, an order of ribs and 2 mains came in a bit over $100 after tax and tip. So for what we turned into a 3 course meal, was perfectly adequate in price and results. I'll come back, but admittedly there are a few other joints in the neighbourhood which have priority in my dining agenda.	neutral
This hidden gem was the perfect place to have lunch and a catch up session with an old friend. We came on a weekday, and it was pretty full already. The menu is a pseudo all day breakfast fare with some lunch options too. I like that they have something different. Farcous is a spinach pancake, flat and crispy. They have a traditional which is mixed also with red onion and cheddar, among others like with smoked meat. It comes with a big salad.My friend got the ploughmans platter, a mix of smoked salmon, hard boiled egg, pate with a salad and other things. It was okay, and perfect to share both dishes. I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the area, definitely check it out.	good
This is the first time I visit this restaurant.  They have more or less the same décor as the last owner.  The food surprisingly is good given the price of the dim sum.  The portion is large.  We order the beef ball and it comes with 4 balls, most of the restaurants only have 3.  One of the baked pie and sweet milk pudding that we ordered are not that good, the rest are above average.  You cannot beat the price with the quality in the location around.  They have lots of parking in the mall.	good
They are CLOSED!!	bad
Looking for a new dim sum place, we ended up at Golden Crown Dynasty Cuisine.Greeted with smiles, we were led into the dining area.  High ceilings, bright yellow walls, and actual cloth table coverings!Sure, there was a giant grease stain in the middle of the table, but I'll pretend I didn't see it.The dim sum menu is extensive and they have some neat items.* I really liked the spicy shrimp dumplings with XO sauce!* The siu mai had huge shrimps and was fresh and piping hot.* Sticky rice was okay but nothing to rave about.* Beef noodle roll had celery in it... that's different...* We gave the crispy abalone pastry puffs a try, they didn't taste too much like abalone though. * The escargot pie with Portuguese sauce was tasty but very sweet* For dessert, we ordered the two colour crystal balls... They looked exactly like the description.  Tasty dessert dumplings where you could see through to the filling (red bean and custard)The food was freshly made and the portions weren't bad.  They give you 3 of everything which is different, there's usually four.  I went with one other person and we had to duke it out for the second piece of items we liked!Overall, I had a nice dim sum experience and I will return if I'm in the hood.	neutral
Food is 4. Price is 5. And it opens at 8am.  just ordered 7 dishes and the bill came at 20.79 loved all dishes in the fried section. Congee was yummy too. My chinece fiancé and I found a nice new breakfast place for a change. Enjoy.	good
I've been visiting Marmalade on and off since I started my new job, and have been here a few times before too. Every time food has been quick, yummy and a good price. Today I had the Ploughman's Salad, which I thought would arrive in a small plastic container and I'd have to eat with those horrendous plastic forks. But no, a big plate of ham, cheese, egg, two kinds of pickle, lettuce and tomatoes landed on my table and I was mighty impressed. All for a paltry sum of £2.60! I think I will be a regular here from now on.	good
I love Cafe Marmalade for various reasons. First of all, it produces amazing flavourful soups which tempt you to come back day after day... Every day they have 3 varieties of soups and you get a large hunk of baguette to go with it as well. So for example a large cup of tomato & bean soup to takeaway is £1.70.  One day I was hesitating between two flavours and the lady kindly offered a wee sample for me to taste which I thought was a nice touch. In fact all the staff there are super friendly and always smiling, which is another reason to go there. Cafe Marmalade also does nice salads, wraps, sandwiches and cakes. They also sell portions of home made foods, e.g. lasagne so I would say pretty much all your lunch time needs are satisfied here :)	good
"A friend suggested we meet here for dinner. I agreed, then looked it up and was horrified by the reviews, and fearful of food poisoning. I told my friend that I would like to go conditionally--we could pop our heads in and if it looked okay, we could stay.It looked okay, when checked out the place--maybe a little unpleasant, in that some of the tables were uncleared and so on, but this might just have been busyness. It was pretty full, with only a couple of seats going to spare. The woman who seated us seemed curt and sullen, however, there was a man who served our table for the most part (the woman refilled our tea once). The man was friendly, smiling and helpful.We went for AYCE. And it was fine. I didn't get food poisoning, which always raises my rating of a restaurant where raw fish is served by one star.*So it was fine. And the rolls were... fine. The ones made for us last night didn't look like they were made by a ""blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw"" (as another reviewer eloquently put it--perhaps a different sushi chef, or else she encountered she same sushi chef as we did, but at the beginning of his career, and how he's in that mid-career slump). On the other hand, perhaps that would have made them more interesting, at least visually? They were pretty standard AYCE, generally. Taste-wise, they were fine, but not fabulous. Each piece of my dynamite roll was too big to manage in one bite, and we all know that this makes for some messiness, as you have to do it in two bites, the flavours don't blend the same way, and unless you're that special combination of skilled and lucky, it falls apart while your'e chewing your first bite. But it was fine. Nothing to write home about (home being Vancouver, where sushi is generally yum and less uneven than the stuff out here, it seems).One special note is the spicy salmon roll. Last summer at a sushi place on the Danforth whose name I do not recall, a friend warned us away from the spicy rolls. He said that they use crappy cuts of fish and disguise it with the spicy sauce. I had never heard of such a thing--we often have sushi out in Waterloo (as we live there part time), and it has always been fine--the same cut of fish as the regular roll, with some spicy sauce drizzled over.Last night, I saw what my friend meant. The spicy salmon roll featured finely chopped salmon, mixed with the spicy sauce--and closer examination confirmed that yes, the lighter stuff in the chopped meat side was not merely sauce, but also fatty, less appealing bits. I tried a bite and this reinforced my friend's warning, which I now pass on to you, with the note that at least for now, in Waterloo, this is not the case. There, the spicy rolls are not crappy cuts of meat disguised by spice. But sadly, at least some AYCE places here, no doubt faced with higher overhead and fierce competition, seem to have decided to take short cuts where they can least afford to--on the food itself, while hoping that the flat rate AYCE pricing will make up for it. The fact that I won't rush back to this place indicates that at least for me, the pricing doesn't make up for it--I'd rather have a tasty bento box, well-prepared, than such mediocre AYCE. *I think my rating would more accurately (from the descriptions) be ""meh--I've had better"" because this is precisely true. But, most people seem to be writing really horrid reviews alongside their two star ratings, so I assume that 2 stars is actually more negative than that and three stars is more of a ""meh"" in practice. I'm going with that."	neutral
BEWARE AND STAY AWAY!!!!For all the local foodies and those who prefer quality customer service. DO NOT go to this restaurant. Mariko Japanese was utterly disappointing.For fear of ranting, I'll try to be straightforward about this. We made a decent size order on what we assumed would arrive in reasonable portions(it is an all you can eat after all) the sizes that came were gargantuan. Starting with udon noodles that was the size of a full entree(oversized) after a minor complaint to the owner who barely acknowledged our annoyance the rest of the food came.. Which was just as ridiculously large followed by more of a sour attitude. My boyfriend and I head to pay the bill and left promptly to take photos of the resto to review later. The owner rampages outside shortly after our departure and begins PUNCHING my bf.. Yes I said it my fellow foodies.. Punching incessantly.. Then runs back inside to grab two glasses of water and douse him and myself with it.. As well as an innocent bystander.. There are no words.. Other than BEWARE and stay away. This was both staggering and unacceptable. Service:0/10Food:1/10Experience:0/10 Downright awful	bad
I was in the neighbourhood to see a documentary and this place was literally across the street. Convenience won the day.It was only after I sat down that I checked Yelp. Based on the reviews I was totally expecting a shitstorm the entire time, but alas, no horrifically crappy service or explosive diarrhea to speak of. Granted, I had a lunch combo and can't speak for the AYCE situation. The service was good, the food was decent. They could've given me more rice though...I was trying to hit my macros jeez. And wondering whether they still serve salad with their hands? Ignorance is bliss.	bad
Bad quality for a cheap price. It's not just the quality of the ingredients, but also the cooking methods. When you taste the chicken and say is this actually cooked enough that is enough to say this place is horrible. I do not say this from just one experience I say this from a couple and Everytime I ask the same question.	bad
After watching a great Hot Doc, my fiance and I were hungry and saw this place directly across the street.  We went with the more expensive AYCE menu.  Service wasn't so good.  Our waitress barely spoke english and was not very attentive.  Never noticed even a smile out of her.  We were seated near the front of the restaurant and felt a draft everytime the door was opened (also, there was a piercing squeak noise that happened everytime the door was pushed open all the way).  Now onto the food...sushi was so so with too much rice used.  Most of the had a pickled taste to it.....not sure what it was nor do I want to know now.  Sashimi was sub par.  Grilled meat tasted a little grisly and wasn't cooked enough.  I guess you pay for what you get and I should have walked further down the street t an a la carte sushi place.  I will not go back to this place...	bad
"After reading all the other reviews on here, I guess we got lucky tonight?The servers seemed tired, but service was still good. We were promptly served our tea and water when we sat down, and the two waitressess tag-teamed our table returning multiple times through the meal to top up both types of drinks.We came for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) dinner on a moderately busy Saturday night - there may have been 4 or 5 other tables being served along with us. On the weekends, the price is apparently raised by $1, so instead of it being $15.99 now, it's $16.99 on a Saturday (and I can only assume that applied to Friday and Sunday as well). (note: they did have the ""lower"" menu for $12.99 weekend price, but my buddy said that one doesn't come with Sashimi, so we went with the higher priced one.The sushi was good. It wasn't great (I lived in Vancouver and have had GREAT sushi back in the day) but in my opinion it wasn't gross as some have suggested by any means. The presentation on our plates was also nice, as our multiple rolls and sashimi came out nicely presented (and our white salmon sashimi - which comes in thin strips - was presented looking like the flower of a rose, a beautifully artistic interpretation that I hadn't seen before.)Sashimi was quite good. Nice and fresh. No complaints. Sushi rolls do come with a lot of rice, but they were tasty too. They had a few rolls I'd never seen before like the ""Excellent Role"" (I know, how awesome of a name is that!) which was shrimp and banana. My girlfriend and I felt adventurous and tried it and it worked really well in our opinion.On the AYCE menu there was only 1 dessert, tempura friend Banana, which they pour a little chocolate over, and it was actually quite tasty. When we finished, they also offered us complimentary ice cream (Green Tea or Coconut flavours).Overall, this place wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I've had better sushi, but I was spoiled living a few years on the west coast. The AYCE menu is pretty thorough with lots of choice, and the price is decent. I've not had much Sushi yet in Toronto since moving here, but this place was pretty good for what you got.I want to say 3.5 stars, but that's not an rating option in Yelp, so this restaurant will benefit from the automatic round-up to 4-stars."	good
Definitely not the best sushi place to be found in the area. Not that it's particularly bad or anything but it just doesn't live up to the standards set by its competition. Food was average and they didn't have the torched sushis, service was surprisingly slow since they had about three servers working and not a lot of people to serve.If you're ever in the area looking to have some sushi, do yourself a favor and walk down the street to another restaurant.	bad
Weird service and you spend some quality time in their bathroom soon after you eat something from their all-you-can-eat menu. Thank god I live nearby so I could rush home and spend time in my own bathroom.	bad
Too much rice filled with vinegar. Subpar if not rude service and stairs that you can die on walking to the washroom where you will want to vomit from the overpriced, terrible eating experience you just had. Got sick from eating here and regret giving these owners any money. Don't believe the signs or the location, this place will be bankrupt soon and is a disgrace to sushi everywhere.  Head over to Big Sushi, Sushi on Bloor or really anywhere on the street you will have food that is 30x tastier with much nicer staff.	bad
This place used to be really good before they renovated the location. However, the last time I went back to this place in September, the sushi rolls were basically the size of a coke can with an extremely big overload of rice. I would actually consider it a rice ball more than sushi. We had ayce but all we ended up getting were the rolls first and by the time we got through the rolls we had no more space for the sashimi. Bottom line, they tried to fill us up with rice so that we would eat less of the sashimi or other food on the menu (cheaper for them). This place for sure will run out of business if they keep this up. Even the lady serving us felt bad and understood when we wanted her to take away the remaining of the rice clumps.	bad
I love this AYCE and even for takeout, I go out of my way to come to Mariko because the rolls are big and the sushi is fresh. But yes, this is an affordable AYCE sushi spot with good customer service--they're pretty sweet and smile and work hard. Like the menu too, and the convenient location.	good
This was my husband's and mine first AYCE sushi place back in the day. It is a special place for us when we were just starting out. We went back for old time's sake for on a weekday night last week and the sushi and tempura were good. You get a choice to eat off the 16.99 AYCE or the 14.99 one. Not the top best but the price is good. The service is nice with a smile. Keep in mind this is in the university area and meant to be affordable. If you are looking for a good place and quick. There were many people coming in for pick up. I realized at the end of the meal that I forgot to take pictures so only managed to get the vegetarian rolls.  Which they have many vegetarian options. Also the fried banana tempura with chocolate is yummy!	neutral
"The first time I walked in to Mariko, I sat at a table waiting for almost 15 minutes for someone to take my order before choosing to just leave. It wasn't busy, almost empty really, and servers could be seen chatting amongst themselves.I should have heeded that warning.Before Mariko, I wouldn't have believed that sushi could be made and served so poorly. The rolls were mostly rice, falling apart from poor construction, actually lukewarm, and the fish (what there was of it) was definitely not fresh. The ""spicy sauce"" that covered some options seemed to be little more than a greasy spiced mayonnaise-like goop that I might expect to see at a roadside Denny's. A server dressed in dirty sweatpants? Dust-covered exposed wiring tangled around the tawdry lighting fixtures? Never again."	bad
This isn't somewhere one goes for the ambience and I'm sure the service varies depending on who's working on a particular evening, but I went here for the first time with a friend last night, and our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The sushi was also fresh, delicious, and well prepared (the $17 AYCE).	good
I personally LOVE Mariko and have been going there for years. The sashimi is always top notch and the service is usually pretty good. It has been most times I have been there.They offer two all you can eat menus that are very reasonably priced and have a decent variety as well.	good
The worst sushi i've ever had in my life! it took more than half an hour to get our food (and they were not busy), when we did finally get it the food was inedible. the rice was soggy & so was the tempura. The staff was barely competent and even after interrogating me as to why i could not eat more than 5 pieces would not even take a dollar off the almost 30 that disgusting meal cost me.	bad
We're regulars here, often going on a weeknight after work.We get great food -- though sometimes a bit uneven. Never had soggy tempura here (or agedashi dofu), though occasionally have had sashimi that was still a bit cold from freezing. Never had poorly rolled rolls, or otherwise sub-par food.No language barrier for us, and we have an established relationship with the servers/chefs. Under these circumstances, the food is excellent. It is not quite as clean as it used to be before the remodel, and service can be, but isn't always, a bit slow. But for the price, its been unbeatable for an all-you-can-eat sushi fix.	good
"Good service and a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices in a super reasonably priced ""all-you-can-eat"" @Bloor & spadina. Consistent quality and bottomless tea. We keep coming back and I am sure they sustain a heavy loss with my s/o that puts away enough vegan sushi to feed a small village..."	good
I wish we had looked at the Yelp reviews earlier but with no phone on us we just walked in, baited by the $16.99 AYCE price. My boyfriend wanted to celebrate a win by taking me to AYCE and we decided to finally cross off Mariko on our AYCE hit-list. For $16.99 all-you-can-eat, we didn't have any high expectations of the food quality. We just wanted to be full and be merry.Food was average-below average but enough to satisfy. Tempura was never crispy (and if you think that's an undercooked yam tempura, no, it's just carrot.) The salmon sashimi was probably the only highlight of our night, though they were poorly deboned.But oh, did we wait... I think we came in at 9:30PM and our first order didn't come in until 10:20ish. There were only three other tables. It was like this with all our orders until closing time. I guess on the bright side, we finally paced ourselves at AYCE and there were a set of flies that entertained us as we tried to keep them off of our chopsticks.Service though? Really bad. Like, I don't think I've ever been this baffled by service in my life especially since my entire family (also Chinese) works in the restaurant scene. To start off, we were handed two sheets for AYCE but no pen/pencil. No plates for anything until we asked for them during our second order. Water has no ice and was lukewarm. I would not be surprised if it was like those restaurant stories my parents tell of places that rinse utensils in drinking water. Ha..Communicating with the staff is terrible. They're always in a rush (to not serve the other customers) and were really condescending. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt especially if English is not they're first language when it comes to tone (since I understand this issue having interacted with so many ESL Chinese) but no... the staff is just plain grumpy 24/7. We were charged an extra ~$4 due to some miscommunication and after waiting for our waitress's 20 minute phone call to end, we flagged her down. We disputed this charge but instead of rectifying this issue (sounds familiar to some other yelp reviews?!) they asked why we even bothered coming here instead of the other AYCEs on Bloor. W-what? We were willing to pay the extra charge since it was a misunderstanding on both ends and it was only $4 but the immediate lashing out that occurred from wanting to get the situation clarified was downright unnecessary. They eventually removed the charge and we even *tipped* them (something I will regret to this day.) I was even more put off by how fiercely the waitress grabbed the money off of the table sans the tray by slamming her palm down on the bills and then clenching them in a fist while I was in the middle of exiting the booth..To those that still want to try Mariko's AYCE for their first time and to those that will unknowingly walk in like we did, stay safe.	bad
Not the best.  Not by far.  But hey, its all you can eat so I guess you just have to accept how mediocre all the food is.	bad
Complete shite AYCE.Yes, it's cheap. But it's freaking awful. I was taken here on a really bad date (first & last) once.The rolls look like they were made by a blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw. They come out mostly rice with one tiny slice of rotten avocado or cucumber as an afterthought, doused in that sickingly sweet glaze sauce that makes everything taste better.The decor is cheap and dated. I can't rememer if the service was horrible or not, so it was probably adequate.There's cheap and then there's Mariko cheap. Don't say I didn't warn you.	bad
Had the AYCE once. Wasn't bad, but not awesome either. Can find better for the price, but maybe not around.Today I tried the chicken Katsudon, and once again flavor was fit for the price (bowl wasn't small, so you get some value).	bad
So me and my girlfriend wanted to eat some sushi and we went here to give it a try and to me it's was pretty crappy.. Their sushi rolls are bad because the seaweed and the rice are old. Not worth the money at all. They're getting 2 stars because the staff are nice and if you order more than $8 you get a choice of 3 pieces of dumplings or sushi.	bad
The red snapper shashimi was soggy and mashed up. The waiter could barely comprehend what I wanted to order. She looked half asleep. I was ordering takeout and I asked for a fork with my garden salad. She predictably forgot. It was difficult just paying for the order--as she seemed so distracted and wasn't on hand to take my cash. My verdict: Mediocre food, poor service	bad
The best part about Marikos is the price. 16.99 for a large selection of sushi. My girlfriend and I used to come here almost every other week (some months once a week). Sadly when i went by on December 12th there was an eviction notice in the window. Heartbroken i made my way to one of the many other restaurants around. RIP Marikos Sushi	good
"This is literally the WORST restaurant experience my boyfriend and I have ever, EVER had. I cannot find the words to express how terrible this place is. If I could give less than one star, I would. Somehow, even the miso soup is awful... the cups tasted like soap but still seemed unclean, and the bowls had little flecks of paint chipping off. The rice was bordering on crunchy, the ""spicy salmon rolls"" looked like dog food smothered in a pinkish hot mayo, wrapped loosely in what I guess was supposed to be a roll. After realizing that the rolls were horrendous, we thought we would stick to kitchen items. This was no safer; I bit into the ""sweet and sour chicken"" to find it was almost entirely raw on the inside.We tried to wash everything down with plentiful amounts of water from our soapy, dingy cups, but the server ignored us entirely and did not refill our cups. We were one of two couples in the place, and yet we were entirely ignored for most of our time there. When my boyfriend went to pay, he saw the cook sleeping in a booth...."	bad
I work at a restaurant as a food runner, and if there is one immutable law of bringing food to a table, it is that you serve all the people at the table as close to simultaneously as you can. I came here with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago, and, given that we are a mere table of two, the difference in time between our receiving of meals should be measured in split seconds. It wasnt. My meal came first, and when it became apparent that hers wasnt coming any time soon, I tried my utmost to exercise self-control in eating my meal. Given that I was sure the fish wasnt the freshest to begin with, I didnt much like the idea of sitting and watching it get older, but propriety demanded it of me. About 15 minutes later, we had both had enough. I was given the green light to begin eating. By the time I was finishing my meal, roughly 15 minutes after that, her meal finally came out. Her avocado Salad consisted of  a whopping amount of iceberg lettuce and a whole quarter of an avocado. We both left the restaurant in a pissy mood, and our hunger was only slightly put off. I spent the next 10 hours skirting around illness. As far as cheap sushi on bloor goes, you can get better for cheaper.	bad
"Cheap sushi, especially for all you can eat. But I've had my order ""rejected"" from delivery because it's too busy in the restaurant... definitely not good enough to warrant that."	bad
"Usually when reviewing Toronto sushi places I talk about how the food was bad but the service was amazing. Today it's going to be switched up a little. The food here was ok. Got a bento for $9.95. Three kinds of maki, all rolled properly, well seasoned rice, avocado and salmon were fresh. Miso soup was very savoury. Salad dressing was awesomely tart. Chicken teriyaki was fine. Spring roll was fine. Tofu was superb. Mountain of food for a low price. Only downside was that the tempura was horrendous. It was soggy. When I walked it in took three minutes to be noticed, greeted, and seated. There were two servers and only four occupied tables (and they were standing about, not at the tables). There's no excuse. The menu is huge so a couple minutes later I'm still holding it in front of my face reading it and a server comes and says ""Are you ready yet?"" and I suppressed a ""Yes, I'm just reading now for the entertainment value"". I order and it takes too long to get to me. While waiting I notice there is a dinner ayce menu which was never offered to me. Oh well, not too hungry anyway, but would have been nice to be told about it. When she brings my food my water is empty. She looks at glass. Doesn't fill it. Ten minutes later she walks by, glass is empty, looks at it, doesn't fill it. Third time she walks by I ask. She still doesn't fill it. Five minutes later another server fills it. I must have tired out the girl by asking her for water because she disappeared but more on that later. As I eat I notice the floor is disgusting. Chopstick here, lump of rice there, no effort to do anything about it. I also notice the server that didn't disappear is just chilling up front drinking a bubble tea instead of working. I finish the food. Server walks by. ""Are you done?"" I say yup. ""Can I get you anything else?"" I say no. Wait 20 minutes, never see a bill. Get up and approach her. As I do I find server #1 sprawled out in a booth taking an effing nap! Can you imagine? Server two says ""Do you want to pay?"" and I suppress a ""No, I'd just thought I'd do laps of the place to work off the bento"". She starts looking at the menu and mumbling to herself. I don't have time for it. Drop 11.25 on the counter and walk out. No tip for the first time in my life. Won't be back."	bad
My partner and I are regulars here and WE LOVE IT.  The food is AMAZING and cheap as it gets for AYCE.  That being said, if you are expecting ambiance and five star service, you're at the wrong place.  We have never really had an issue with service, in fact, because we are regulars, we have established a relationship with the regular server and the chefs; as such, when they are in we get special treatment (free drinks, special sushi not on the menu, etc.).Bottom line, for the price, the quality of the food is top notch but you won't get much else unless they get to know you.	good
Yeah this place pretty much uses pretty poor quality of fish and small cuts. We did not order the all you can eat either. This is what happens when instant gratification and starvation are mixed.	bad
WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE....We went in for the 10.99 all u can eat...  The service was slow and sub-par  but this didn't really bother me... The food was really bad and the worst sashimi I have ever tasted...but still whatever it was only 10.99 right?  Well  when i went to pay they wanted to charge us 17.99, even though all of the banners say 10.99.  After a brief argument the one waitress called the manager on the phone screaming in Japanese  and finally charged us 10.99, still insisting she told us when we ordered that we were getting the more expensive menu??  SHE DID NOT....  This is where it gets good...  she than yells at me saying Im never welcome again.. I said fine...this is the worst sushi I have ever had and I wouldn't dream of coming back..she than barked  at me again.   At this point I had enough and told her where to go, at which point the waitress turned around and slapped me in the face twice  YES  she actually physically assaulted me!!!   But it didnt stop there!  She then shoved me into a table...After this I unleashed hell fire on her and ran out.  I'm still pondering pressing assault charges just not sure if i want to waste any more energy on it... I'm still shocked it happened....Difficult customer or not you NEVER lay a hand on a customer.  The place was full as well with a lot of witness's.	bad
Just don't eat here, trust me. They forgot our order not once - not twice- but FIVE TIMES. Each time we had to fill out a new order sheet and give it to them and they lost it each time! Not to mention the food was an embarrassment. How this place is still in business is beyond me.	bad
The Good:There are two options for AYCE. So, for people who only like Veg, Chicken, or Beef in their rolls and no fish you don't have to pay full pop.The decor is in keeping with the nicer sushi restaurants in the area.The Bad:Way too much rice on the sushi. I know there is supposed to be rice on sushi, I'm not freaking out over carbs. This was out of hand. There was hardly any fish in the rolls! Where are the nice big chunks of salmon and tuna? The rolls were not well assembled. some where falling apart when picked up with chop sticks - the sign of a poorly trained (if at all) sushi chef. We like to order a lot of sashimi. The first round of salmon sashimi was excellent. The second round was clearly cut the tail end of the fish were there is more marbling and fat. This cut of salmon is not normally for sushi. It's creamier consistency is better for some rolls, but not sashimi. The severs were nice, but very difficult to communicate with. This is pretty typical for a lot of sushi restaurants in the area. The Ugly:When you're given a menu and pen/pencil to fill it out, a 4cm pencil covered in black gunk is not what you want when you're ordering food. It took forever for our first order to arrive! I'm not expecting fast food, but at least bring out the first roll or two within 15 minutes.***The lesson here: you get what you pay for. ***This place is about 30% cheaper than other AYCE sushi restaurants in the area, and the quality of the food is at least 30% lower. I like quantity when it comes to sushi, but quality counts for so much more.	bad
worst sushi place ever! The food is not fresh (you can see black stuff on the avocado). The fish is not fresh also, the taste is a bit weird. There are orders missing so we have to order again. When the order came, there is soooooooooooo much rice on the roll (i never see that much rice in a roll). Even the yam tempera is not sweet. Worst place ever.  too bad i forgot to take picture of the food to prove myself.	bad
TERRIBLE. RUN. FAST!! (and pray that you can hold your diarrhea in until you get home).Food is horrible.  The AYCE signs outside are a come-on, and the whole thing is a scam because the rolls are 90% rice.  Fish is NOT FRESH. And they serve the cheapest (i.e., fried/rice-heavy) items first and conveniently 'forget' about the sashimi, etc.  Staff is incredibly rude.  Floors and tables are filthy- would hate to see what their kitchen looks like if this is their cleanliness standard.Partner and I were sick for days after.  Not sure how they are still in business...?	bad
"My buddy, Eric, and I come here for lunch pretty much every Tuesday and order one of their lunch specials.  They are an unbelievable deal.  For example, for just $5.25, you receive miso soup and a bento box with chicken teriyaki, rice, salad, 4 California rolls and two tofu cubes (somewhat sauteed).  Hey, you also get a bottomless cup of green tea.   We've been alternating restaurants in the Annex area for years but this has been the most popular for us.  Healthy and a terrific deal.  Can't beat this place.  And, after all these years, the staff knows us so it's kind of like walking into Cheers for us.  ""Norm!"""	good
I came here many times--even by myself when my fiancee was in Europe. Honestly, the rolls are DELICIOUS. They're generously sized and you get so much variety for the $15.99 all-you-can-eat dinner. I love it there and the rolls come pretty quickly. They're so good and fresh--nothing tastes cold or stale.I can't wait to go back!! :) PS. Sashimi is included in the all-you-can-eat price! And specialty rolls like Dynamite etc.	good
One word: mediocre. The rice was hard, the fish was poor quality, and the sashimi cuts were small and sad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone in the area. Service was poor and there were an incredible amount of flies in the restaurant. Without those flies, this would be a 2 star.	bad
This is the WORST SUSHI IN TOWN. DO NOT GO. Popped in before a movie which is the only reason it does any business I am guessing from reviews below. YIKES! I was in a hurry for a take-out order. TWO of us got SICK with BAD STOMACHS for two days! The place is FILTHY, starting with the front door, fingerprints, and dirty floors. A very bad sign. The first thing I clocked inside were the Chinese (nothing Japanese here) employees and owners' SHOES thrown on the floor in front of the 'sushi bar!' Only one couple in the restaurant. Mops are visible, brooms, and crap surrounds the food area. The first banquet is totally covered full with papers and plastic bags, there are filthy chairs that need to be tossed they are so dirty dirty dirty. The staff who wore dirty tops barely understood my order, and though the prices are good, the food made ever so slowly by a tired elderly Chinese gentleman (who looked as though he should have his feet up in front of TV not working) was the worst I have ever had. IGNORE any reviews that like this place, those are not people with any food standards whatsoever. FEH!	bad
I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place. I have been several times and have always enjoyed the food and found the service to be very good. I have never had an issue with quality and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Mariko.I eat a lot of sushi and I have most of the sushi restaurants in the area. Mariko is as good as any of the others.	good
Why oh WHY did I let my stomach sucker me into coming here?I know I say this about pretty much every Japanese restaurant except Japango, Asahi and Yuzu no Hana, but this has to be the worst one in Toronto.OBVIOUSLY it is run by Chinese folk, not Japanese, which makes it all the more obvious why it sucks. I asked for a substitution and they said: NO CAN DO, until I offered to pay more money to avoid eating crap. *rolls eyes*I ordered the Wakame Salad, which came drenched in a disgustingly sweet sauce of sesame. Not a drizzle, a SOUP of dressing covering the few leaves of wakame is not my idea of a good Japanese salad.The miso soup was standard but I only got 2 tofu cubes.I also got the chicken teriyaki which was not what I was expecting, it came as a sizzling hot plate instead of drenched in that thick lovely soy sauce and flavoured beautifully. It lacked seasoning, was on a bed of horribly cooked onions and carrots, and I was so hungry, I ate it all.But I am never coming back, and if you had a smartphone (unlike me, as I am internet-less most of the time I am out of the house), you would have yelped this and avoided it like the effing plague.	bad
I came for the AYCE and remind me never to go for all you can eat.  MSG induced perhaps?  I never feel like I get my dollars worth since I don't eat that much...I've had their lunch specials which were ok.  Unfortunately I don't remember what I ordered but it was your standard annex sushi bento box...	bad
There are plenty of questions that humans will ponder over long periods of time to try to find an answer to. What is life? Are we alone in the universe? How is Mariko still in business? We may never find out the answer to that last one, but let's try to wrap our heads around it for the time being. Sure, it may be relatively cheap for an AYCE, but starving to death is also cheap. At least with the latter you can die a dignified death and not have your hippocampus tarnished with the memory of ever coming to this place. With poor service, a menu with text printed in the smallest size font in faded red (ask the staff for a magnifying glass if you don't have your electron microscope handy), low quality fish, and a whopping 7 conditional passes from Dinesafe(!) under its belt, it truly is a wonder how this place is still around. Considering the rising presence of Japanese food in the area, such an environment should've put this place out of its misery ages ago. For those that have already made the mistake of coming here at some point, especially if it is your first AYCE experience, I am sorry. For those that have not been here, run. Run as fast as you can.	bad
I've only been for AYCE, and while for the price I don't anticipate stellar service, I do simply ask that my request to have my food not come in contact with animal products be respected. I don't need sterilized separate utensils, but not having to return a large plate of avocado maki that is covered in roe would be awesome.Even in my omnivorous days, fish and seafood grossed me out. This kind of experience doesn't really help the matter much.The prices are solid if you have no dietary restrictions, and they've never once cut me off, even though I can devour an inhumane amount of food.Go in with minimal expectations, and an empty stomach.	bad
"I've visited Mariko on Bloor (near Bathurst) twice now, and was surprised to see it wasn't listed on Yelp yet.My first visit to this location was initiated by their signage.  They always seem to have some sort of special on, which is great for students.  They have a $10.99 AYCE menu (albeit VERY limited), and a $14.99 AYCE which includes sashimi (2 or 3 types).  They also have ""FREE DAYS"", where each day of the week, you get something free with your meal (ie. tofu & miso on Sundays).Both times I have been there, service has been brutal.  There were times that the waitress was just sitting at a table with her head down, and one of the chefs would come over to serve us after our failed attempts to get her attention.The first visit, I ordered à la carte, and the food came out beautifully prepared and displayed.  (see picture I will be uploading)The second visit, which was AYCE, it was as though they couldn't care less.  It was all just laid on a big plate in rows.  The salmon sashimi came out in super thin slices, yet all still stuck together by some fatty tissue at the corner.  I have never seen sashimi cut so poorly in my life!  And the fish just did not seem like sushi grade.  I was so disgusted, I didn't re-order anything but basic rolls.  But even the spicy salmon roll was purely mushy, and it appeared that the chef hadn't cleaned his prep area between preparing rolls.  Rolls that weren't supposed to have fish eggs on them had a few scattered bits of tobiko around the outside, that clearly didn't come from just being on the plate.  It's so important for sushi chefs to use clean surfaces when preparing different rolls or fish.   For a second time, I was disgusted.The interior is a cold blue, and the lighting is just as unwelcoming.  I think they've installed fluorescent lighting panels on the walls, and put transparent images of bamboo over them, as if they could act as sconces.  FAILWe overheard a diner behind us asking the waitress to recommend something delicious he hadn't tried before, and she suggested the dynamite roll.  I couldn't believe it.  The customer looked pretty disappointed too.  If I had to rank the million sushi places on Bloor, Mariko would be wayyy down on my list.  If you're going to try it, my only advice is not to go for the AYCE.  It's just not worth it in the end if you can't enjoy your meal.  Part of the joy of sushi is the presentation and preparation.  It should be a feast for the eyes as well, and Mariko seems to think that it's alright to offer an inferior meal to their AYCE customers.Later found out they had a conditional pass back in April '09.

Empfehlen! Service ist nett! Zweimal gebratene Schweinefleisch ist top! Verkaufen zwar auch Nudel-Box, aber ist ein richtige chinesische Sichuan Restaurant!要到附近办事，在谷歌上偶然看到这个饭店，评价都不错；于是毫不犹豫去了。的确。服务热情，笑容亲切；开张8个月。内部还很新，很整洁。桌椅比较类似麦当劳肯德基的装潢，感觉亲切但又有快吃快走的感觉。菜：凉拌藕片，回锅肉（9，5欧元），鱼香茄子；都很赞！决定下回再去！	good
It's a very authentic Sichuan restaurant, though with limited menu. The price is one of the reasonable in the city. 3 mains, 1 entrée, and 2 drinks only cost 30 euros. Most dishes are spicy, better watch out for Sichuan pepper and not bite it. A bit packed with Chinese; so, it could be somehow noisy. Recommendation: Spicy beef salad	good
店堂不大，我到的早，周末中午第一拨客人，随后陆续来了不少中国人外国人，拖家带口的，小情侣，嗯，虽说不在城中心，但在Straßebahn口处，交通算不错了。主要菜烧的挺正宗，德国的广东人上海人开的饭店多，虽说也提供部分川菜但不正宗为多数，这家主人四川人烧的正宗，当然品种并不算繁多	good
Family owned restaurant, staff are from SiChuan province and serve authentic SiChuan flavored dishes.	good
"The Fox Bistro is the restaurant at the Radisson so we were assuming that the food would be fine and gave it a try as we had a coupon for it.As you walk in, the first thing you notice is that it is very dated inside, and the bar crowd. We were the only table in the whole place besides some people staying at the hotel watching the world cup and having some drinks at the bar.The menu is very simple, not big at all. I wasn't very hungry so I just got a club house while my other got the lasagna. The waiter wasn't paying any attention to us at all, he was busy watching the game with the guys at the bar, we had to keep getting his attention. If we were the only table don't you think he should of gave us just a little more attention?When the food finally came, I saw all these yellowish looking stuff on my sandwich, the description said mayonnaise NOT HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE! I dislike mustard and I was shocked to see honey mustard all over my sandwich, I have never seen a club house with mustard on it, so I was very surprised.The lasagna looked very portion packed and when we asked about it, the waiter said ""its frozen, we just heat is up"" you would assume for 20 bucks at least could  make their own lasagna. What's the point going to a restaurant to have something heated up when you can do the same thing at home?I'm glad I had to chance to see what this place was about as I was curious but I will never be going back."	bad
We went in this restaurant in the hotel because it was convenience, not my choice but my family's. Milestones and Swiss Chalet were too busy for them on a Friday night, no one in this place so quiet. Apps were good, nice French onion soup but small portion. Do not order sandwiches, very small portions on grocery store sandwich bread and small sides - not worth price. I make nicer grilled cheese sandwiches at home, without finger holes in the bread. While server was attentive, he overstayed his welcome. My family was on a stopover so it was my only night to see them for a few hours. The server lingered and made inappropriate conversations we were not interested in having, even going so far to joke about my RMT career and refer to me as a masseuse. We did not want to be rude, so we eventually left irritated. I served for 12 years and would never imagine lingering unwanted at a table making conversations of my own choice to pass the time.	bad
My girl friend and I stayed at this Radisson twice and were given continental breakfast vouchers on both occasions. We didn't have time to take advantage of it the first time but we decided to give it a try on our second visit.The moment we walked into the restaurant  was like going through a time machine. Boy~ the decor was immensely outdated; it felt as if we had just gone from year 2010 to 1980's...The experience pretty much went down hill from that moment and on...1. the waitresses were not very attentive at all even though we were THE ONLY table.2. The continental breakfast only included the cold section of the break (breads, fruits and croissant...) but we chose to to add $6 for hot buffet because the croissants and fruits had obviously been left for several days (no jokes, the croissant had a kind of fermenting smell to it) and spoiled. 3. Fine... so off we go to the hot buffet (the selection was very LIMITED) but we thought how can we go wrong with $6 buffet? WRONG! The scramble eggs was blah and the bacons tasted like it'd been several days old...Well, I can go on and on about how bad this place is but I won't... You probably get the idea anyway... Stay away from this place since there are so many choices (and MUCH better) right outside the steps of this hotel (Tim Horton's, Kelsey's, Subway, Milestones, Sushi, Swiss Chalet and etc...).	bad
"I'll eat anything. Don't get me wrong. I love great food. But I'm also not super picky.This was terrible. Awful. First of all, breakfast isn't hard. But it was for them. The buffet seemed lackluster so I ordered eggs Bennie. It's kind of my ""treat"" when I'm traveling. I was informed a little after I ordered I couldn't have them because they were out of English muffins and ham. It's Thursday. Really? So I opted for the buffet. The hash browns tasted rancid. That made me fear the eggs. They actually tasted okay. But by then I was put off. The bacon was half cooked and so greasy. And the sausages - well at least they were cooked through.The muffins were stale and the croissants were undercooked (hint: they shouldn't be white).I felt bad for the server because she seemed aware everything was crappy. She was at least quick to refill the coffee (which wasn't terrible).I wasn't expecting 5 star dining but this was ridiculous."	bad
Sonora Hot Dog...How can you go wrong with a bacon wrapped hot dog?  Pretty good when your hungry and tired from walking up and down the strip.	neutral
First time here.. and when I seen what the menu looked like I was sold.. sandwitches looks awsome and prices was good.. I question the food about size and tease.. the owner jac then approached me and told me that they had the best sandwitches In vegas and if I didn't like it he would refund me my monry.. so I took him on his word.. and I have to say that the man was not lieing.. the sandwitch I had a long time.. the new york bomb was great and would tell anyone to try it.. jac&ray they can cook a good sandwitch.. looking forward to another and everytime I come to vegas I will be make sure to go there	good
Not bad, cheap and on the strip too.  One of the best places on the strip to eat that will not make you take out a loan.	neutral
This is in the food court in Fashion Show Mall.  This was a pretty good meal for the price.  I ordered the Cubano and was quite pleased.	good
Jac and Ray has been open for a few years,  I used to go all the time. They were less expensive to get a burger meal, than any other place in the mall.After drastic changes in management, the service became horrible, and the prices started going up. I stopped going there, and it's been over a year since I had last been there.I decided to give them another try. The quality of service has improved 100%. The girls behind the counter, were very friendly and efficient! The time it takes to get your food is still very long. However the burger is made of fresh ingredients. The first time back, will not be the last time.	neutral
The service was friendly. I ordered a Cuban sandwich and enjoyed it. The price was reasonable.	good
This is one of the most affordable and tastiest spots at the Fashion Show food court. Their menu carries a good variety of salads, sandwiches and appetizers for a good price ($4-$9). The service is fast and friendly and the portions are generous. Food tips: The papanachos (cheese, bacon, side of ranch), chicken tenders, black angus burger, and Philly cheesesteak are great options for lunch. And if you are really hungry... Make your sandwich a meal and upgrade your fries to papanachos for a few extra dollars.	good
More of meh food. Real messy. Messy taste and can be pricey. Cheese and bacon fries aren't that great. NY wasn't great. Found a curly hair. Just... Okay food.	neutral
It was not what this thing hyped it out to be. A total fail. I wouldnt choose this place over Wendys.	bad
Amazing food for being a fast food restaurant. Every ingredient is fresh & high quality. Delicious, very affordable & generous portions.They also make excellent breakfast. Should definitely stop by, too good for food court food!!! :)	good
Came here for a late lunch with Uncle, nephew and Jessica M. We all almost got the same thing. Well me and my nephew did. We both got the New York bomber but I got  my fries Papanachos style. It was a little more pay but it looked good. And yes it was good. A little salty cause of the bacon bits. My Jessica M. got the Cuban fusion. It was really good. I'd come back but I would try the Philly and the fish and chips. The place is in the food court of the Fashion Show Mall.	good
"Other reviewers elsewhere complain of long waits and poor service, but we didn't experience either. Not the most friendly staff, but they were efficient and we had our breakfasts in just a few minutes. I chose the breakfast special - $4.99 (two eggs - any style - bacon ham or sausage, and toast) my eggs were ""over-easy"" and were done perfectly. My friend had pancakes - $2.99 and she said they were quite good.Our experience was good enough to try lunch - big sandwiches that look quite tasty."	neutral
I was desperate and had no choice but eat at the food court.  After standing in line for what seems like hours at the Wendy's, I gave up and made my way to Jac & Ray where I was immediately greeted and helped.  I had the pita with chicken, cheese, mushrooms, onions and bell peppers.  The portion was very large and the flavors were actually really good.  Don't waste your time and money at other mediocre food stands and try Jac & Ray instead.	good
Went in today at 1:55 pm. And ordered a plain veggie sanwhich and nothing else, and was gonna order a combo but the last cut me off and told me my total without her full attention. Waited 25 minutes for a god damn sandwitch with that could be made in 2 minutes! Walked up to the counter and demanded a refund, and apparently my order was never even on the system!! But I did see people come before and after me get their order! The people working were busy on their phones and kept walking to the back, like they didn't even care and they were messing up other peoples orders! I am so mad! tried going on the company site to complain to corporate but could not find it. So decided to post on here. I would give this place a zero stars if I could. I will never come back to this place. The two girls working didn't even say sorry or try to correct it. Please find better people with proper customer service so this won't happen to anyone else. There was an older lady waiting as well a after me and I had to break it to her that my order wasn't even there, and she went and complained as well. My email adress crazyandevil13@yahoo.com if any managers or corporate need to contact me for an apology.	bad
Very good and inexpensive Dim Sum in Toronto.  Worth searching for!	good
Toronto dim sum is the standard by which all others are judged, not having had any significant amount of dim sum in China.  Even a dim sum restaurant owner in San Francisco agreed with me.  This is my favourite cheap dim sum spot in Toronto, and I've ne ver had a bad meal.  There are other places that are fancier or with a bit more variety, but you will pay significantly more.  Your choice!I've been going here since it was called Imperial Gourmet Garden.  Then one day they closed up shop, changed the name on the door, and reopened with this new name.  All the same people out front, and presumably in the kitchen.  The dim sum has always been tasty, and quite the bargain during the week.  Pay a little attention to the cart-pushing-waiters...you might just learn a little Cantonese!The beef ribs are excellent, and quite hard to find many places.  Also, malai go is super tasty...it's like steamed sponge cake.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.  On a Sunday, get there before the crowds swarm the place at 11:30-ish.	good
"The one Cantonese word I'm so proud to know is ""shaomai""!This Chinese dumpling is served as part of the countless dim sum carts at Yiu Wah Restaurant. Dim sum, meaning ""from the heart"", is an anytime food but best had from 11:30am to 1pm - that's when the carts are at high volume sending around your favourite dishes (which go for $2-3 for a small dish but when you get a whole bunch for a full table of hungry people, your very satisfying lunch will only cost you 8-10 happy dollars). The only thing is you might not see the same food carted around in every visit. They have their usual but when they'll show up is always a fun mystery.There is an obvious language barrier here but so worth it. Don't be ashamed to just point and nod at food here. It's socially acceptable.Among my favourites:* the aforementioned shaomai (w/ pork)* sweet & sour pork* steamed bean curd rolls* pork bunA surprise hit with me:* crab ballsA MUST HAVE!:* garlic green beans (the BEST I've ever had ANYWHERE! But order this from the waiter once you sit down because this does not get carted around with the rest of them).Also, get the table by the kitchen. The food is hot, fresh and it always goes to you first. Of course, you'll have to fight me for it should we be there at the same time."	good

I go out of my way to visit other Tim locations....I dreadfully pass by this one on my way to the doctors so I usually end up ordering.This location always messes up my drink orders. My iced cap had no ice at all. It was just cool liquid. I was in a rush to the doctors so I didn't have time to go back. And then when my mom ordered last time, they used the table cloth to wipe the the edge of the rim when they overfilled it...The edge of the rim...where she was going to drink from...looks unsanitary. I would not have taken that drink had it been me. The only redemption is that they make a mean grilled cheese panini. If I know I have to pass by this location, I always bring my water bottle with me for my thirst needs now.	bad
This is a Tim Hortons and Wendy's combo location with a drive through.Nothing much to add since it's a chain and the service and type /quality of food and drinks are predictable....	good
Dreadful Tim Horton's, I asked for a toasted bagel with cream cheese and received one that was black, drenched in butter. Disgusting! My advice: go to the Wendy's and order yourself a sour cream and chives baked potato, $2 and they're amazing!	bad
My first time to the Boneyard ... and won't be busting down any doors to go back.  The place was rather empty on Tuesday night when we went.  I ordered the grilled porkchops, fries, and coleslaw.  My honey ordered the meatball sub and cajun fries.  We both came to the conclusion that we liked the fries ... regardless of the flavor.  The meatball sub was average.  The pork chops were grilled pretty well and had a good taste, but were really more along the size of a lamb chop.   One bite of the coleslaw and I was done with it.  It was a creamy based slaw with little to no taste.  I would bet we could find a pre-made container from one of the big-box warehouse joints.Our server was very good and attentive.  She helped with the menu and gave us plenty of time to unwind from work over our beers before ordering.  If I could pair the server with a better food experience, then it would have been a much better visit.Better luck next time when I try something different ...	bad

Purchased a Groupon, wanted to try it mainly because of the location. Went on a friday night, the place was DEAD, except for a few LOUD drunks at the bar. I mean this place should be packed with all the room and TVs. Also, it was snowing out and I rarely get cold in places and I was freezing in here. How is this place staying in business?Food was cold, nothing special, pretty sure my veggies were frozen...Service was subparNo thanks! Go to Outback next door :)	bad
Ok, so its not the greatest bar in the world, but they have beer and there is never a wait because nobody goes there.  Is that good?	neutral
Went here on New Year's Eve only because our first two choices didn't work out. It was practically empty. The first thing we noticed was that it was pretty cold in there. Either they didn't anticipate enough clientele to be worth heating the place or they figured they'd be so busy the body heat would warm it up. Either way, it was kind of uncomfortable.My salad and my girlfriend's soup were both good so we got off to a good start food wise. My steak was good, though I was disappointed there weren't any dinner rolls. The baked beans I got looked a little pureed but they were very good. I wanted a baked potato but they didn't have any. I got mashed potatoes instead but didn't like them because they were chunky (kind of like potato salad).My girlfriend said her steak salad was good, but the breadstick it came with was undercooked to the point it was cold in the middle. The chocolate cake we had for dessert was very good.The service itself was pretty weak. That would have been understandable if it was very busy but there were only a few other people there so that was disappointing. The bathroom decor was great but it was pretty filthy in there. Again, not sure how that could happen based on the lack of customers.Overall, it was pretty good and I'll go back but they certainly have opportunities for improvement.	good
Been there a coupla times & every time the food was good. The bad things it has going for it are: 1) there are MANY other alternatives that serve the same types of food (american sports bar food)- they're not setting themselves apart 2) beer selection is slim compared to the old Boneyard downtown near gateway. When I think of Boneyard, I think of 'vast beer selection', but you but don't get that here.The Good things are that the food is good, service is great & personal, and the kids like the TVs & Video game room. We'll go there again, but after we've done the rounds on the other place. If they increased the beer selection to include craft beers/ beers you can't get at similar genre restaurants, we'd prolly go there more often. This place seemed dead for a friday night, hopefully its busier on the weekends. I would like to see this place work out.	neutral
"We went because we got a deal on Groupon. The food was nothing special..like a normal American restaurant. A sports bar/grill.Got fish n' chips plus a combo platter (half ribs and pulled pork). The deal was good for us because of the coupon.But I was rather disappointed in their ""Game Room"". I was expecting something like Dave and Buster type of game room..but oh man..this game room was literally a 4ft by 3ft room with a few game machines....rather sad.Probably not going to go back again unless we happen to be there for some reason."	neutral
We took the family and friends to the Boneyard last week after my son's game. The staff was prompt and attentive. Two people ordered the cheese soup and sent it back due to the fact that it was way too salty and had the consistency of pudding. I had the ribs, Big Mistake! The ribs were pre-cooked. Then reheated and jar sauce dumped over them.The food is fair bar food at best. I went to the one in Broadview Heights when it opened and the food was very good. Oh my how far they have fallen. If you go there stick to burgers, fried frozen fish or chicken planks.I would put money that this place will close within a year. Fix the food fast fellas!	bad
The decor and service were ok but the food (ny strip steak, mashed pot, thai noodles, apple pierogie) was really bad.  Maybe their other items are better but everything we had tonight was pretty bad and definitely not worth the money.	bad
"Previously visited a different Bone Yard location and was very pleased.  Unfortunately, they are not all beholden to the same standards evidently.  The first warning sign was that at 4 PM on a Saturday Evening, the place was empty while every place around it was completely packed.  I ordered a Boneyard Burger and fries.  Fries were completely room temp when brought to the table.  The worst, however; came in the form of the Boneyard ""burger"".  The supposedly beef patties were grey and paper thin.  Preformed, frozen patties!  Seriously?  The patties weren't the only things frozen....There seems to be no one in the place willing to turn on the heat.  We never removed our coats the entire time we were there.  The server was pleasant, however."	bad
"This place sets a new standard for disgusting. Dirty interior, dirty bathrooms, slow/absent minded wait staff, horrendous taste in music coming out of a poor quality  sound system...I just don't know what to say to adequately encapsulate this restaurant. I guess making an analogy would be pretty good. You ever seen any of the National Lampoon's movies? Do you remember ""Cousin Eddie""? Well if Cousin Eddie opened up a restaurant this is what you would get.The food they served here should be illegal in the state of Ohio. That pretty much sums it up for me. If you really are in the mood for this kind of food please do yourself a favor and find a BW3 instead. Now you'll have to pardon me while I try to lay down and fight back this nausea."	bad
I came here for the first time a few years ago with my friend and have been back numerous times ever since and introduced other friends to it.First off, the service is AMAZING! Staff are always extremely friendly and attentive and food comes very quickly, no matter how busy it is, although I usually go at lunch on weekdays so it is not overly busy.The salads come in 2 sizes, small and large but small is definitely meal sized, I wouldn't order a large unless I was starving or sharing with somebody. My go to is always the Chinese chicken salad. The dressing is perfect and there's a good amount of chicken. I also recently tried a bite of my boyfriends salad, he got the seafood cesar. The name to me sounded bizarre but it had crab and shrimp and was actually quite good!I haven't tried many other things on the menu because I tend to stick to what I like (selective eater over here) but I have tried their egg drop soup in the past which was very good as well as the roast beef sandwich.I will continue to come back here as the prices are very reasonable, the service is amazing, and the food is always delicious!	good
In a former life, I worked in an office not far from Dr. Deli and his arisocratic wife. My colleagues loved the place. I was unmoved. Dr. Deli violates one of my cardinal rules of dining out: they serve food that I can make at home. Salads? Sandwiches? Soups? Stuff I've been banging out since Home Ec class. What's unforgiveable is that their food turns out worse than mine. Undercooked pea soup is grany; salad leaves arrive with brown edges, wilting under puckery-sour dressings. Coffee is zombie-grey. Bread arrives with the standard packets of shelf-stable whipped butter. I go to take one. It's already open, and the butter is missing except for a crumb-laden smear in the miniature plastic tub. They gave me used butter. They can keep it. Clearly, Dr. Deli requires better bedside manners.	bad
Just came from Sid Silver and was hankering for some salad dish with meat (as I am a meatatarian) and we ended up at the plaza corner of Dufferin and Steeles because of Cora's.  However, I noticed this small restaurant in the back corner and checked their menu on the window and made sure there were actual customers as the one beside Cora's looked eerily empty so I did not bother going there.Anyway I went in and ordered their Chinese Chicken Salad small sized for $6.99. I chose small because looking at the large size it seems like too much salad. I also ordered with their sesame dressing.Along with the salad I ordered the bacon and cheese potaato skins as the appetizer for $5.95. So I got the salad first. Surprisingly the bowl was not just for show, it was quite full. Lots of veggies (which I was after), some pieces of chicken, Mandarin orange slices, and some fried noodles. The tart sesame salad dressing blends well with the salad.  Don't throw the entire dressing into the salad, just do a little bit at a time. However, something was missing in order to make me fully happy. Thankfully the tato skins arrived and after taking a bite, the taste just balanced very well.No free wifi. However, I am happy with the price, service and quality. So I gave this 5 stars for this experience.	good
Super nice waitress, fast and friendly. I love their seafood salad with unique chinese chicken ceaser dressing. The best salad i have ever had. The omlette i have to say taste better than mine.	bad
"If I only going review Dr Deli and the Salad Queen based solely on the food... I would have just rated this place as a 3 star.... but we got exceptional services from the waitress. My Lunch buddy has this thing for soup...but she just couldn't decide which one to go with since there are 3 choices for ""Soup of the Day""... While she looked to be for help and knowing me I am not good with deciding.. I asked our waitress for help... 1/2 Roast Beef and Soup ($6.95)Waitress: Potato Soup is the Best.. Friend: hmmm how is the chicken noodle? Waitress: Potato Me: Beef and Barley... Waitress: Potato Friend: What is Barley... Finally, we decided on the Beef and Barley...but our lovely waitress took out 3 samples for us to try.... I never have that happen to me... and finally after voting and intensive taste testing... We agreed on the Potato!! It is more like a really light broth with veggie inside and it was delicious! I usually don't want to order anything with ""Chinese"" when I am in a non ""Chinese"" restaurant...but with all these reviewers raving about Chinese Chicken Salad ($6.95), I have to try it out! Small is Large! Me and my friend having trouble finishing that.... and there is nothing really Chinese about the salad...aside from those fried noodles.. The half Roast Beef sandwich on rye ended up I have to save it for pre dinner snack for later... I definitely will come back here if I have another salad attack... and I would be bring my friend!!"	good
Dr. Deli and the Salad Queen, ah, good times.  This place has changed ownership more often than Paris Hilton changes boyfriends.  As such, I feel like the quality of the food has gone down over the past few years.  We used to come here all the time, and the salad was delicious.  But, I came here about a month or so ago (actually, it was one of the first places I went once I moved back from the states) and I was disappointed.  So, this review is based more on hope and memories - hoping that it's still as good as it was in the past.	good
"Don't be fooled by the cheesy decor of this ""hole in the wall"" type of place, because I'm telling you this is one of the best lunch spots ever and I frequent it on a regular basis. The Chinese Chicken Salad is excellent, and as a veggie option you can substitute the chicken with shredded cheese (which is also very good!) The salads are huge for the price, and be warned, a large can easily feed 2-3 people, while a small is the perfect size for 1. Their salad dressings are incredible, and I'm pretty sure they sell them in big bottles to take home. (House Sesame and Ranch are my personal favourite!)I've been told the other things on the menu are pretty good too, but I've only ever tried the various salads. Now I have to say, the service is not the best, but the place is small so it's easy to flag someone over if you need to. The food does come quickly, but expect the server to disappear after you've been brought your food, and possibly not visit for the duration of the meal. Take out is always super quick, even if you don't call your order in in advance."	good
The only place to get a Chinese chicken salad that is actually good, this little hole in the wall is located in a strip mall at Duffrin and Keele. Along with delicious salads and healthy options, Dr. Deli also has great burgers and sandwiches. You will also get a kick out of the kitchy interior decor and the art that hangs on the walls (most items are for sale). As a regular for the past 10 years, Dr. Deli has been a constant spot for me and my friends.	good
Dr. Deli is a great place for healthy food. They have quite a few variety of Salads. The best is Chinese chicken caeser salad (mix), the Greek seafood salad is also pretty good. I love the service, as it is so fast and good. I like the ambience, its not too rushy or loud. Its not pricey, and the best place to come specially if you are diet conscious. They also have some great meaty sandwiches, if you do not happen to like salads.I have been here a few times, and I always leave with a desire to come back. I really recommend it!	good
"I have been going to Dr. Deli for years as I work right around the corner. However, I find since the new owners took over I am never satisfied. The vegetables are always brown and something is always missing when I pick up an order. Whenever I call to them about my issues they never really seem to apologize, rather blame it on me; ""you did not tell me no sunflower seeds"" (i did) ""don't leave the salad in the car or the veggies get brown"" (i never do) ""my chef forgot to put in the carrots, I will give you extra next time"" (I watched her make my salad, not a chef & my salad literally had lettuce, cheese and 4 mandarin oranges in it). I miss Vince - he would have given me a free salad as an apology."	bad
Sandwich was okay, the fries were somewhat raw still.  Went here around noon and it got a bit busy, the staff looked like they were in a rush.	bad
This place is located in the dufferin/steeles plaza with the shoppers. I came here for a late lunch and despite no one being around, the service was quick and efficient.I really like the hot sandwich here, specifically the corned beef sandwich. However, I am taking off 2 stars for the subpar quality of the 'caesar salad'. I opted for the carsar salad for an extra $2. I was disappointed with the salad as it only had some not so fresh salad and pieces of stale, perhaps home made croutons.  However, I do suggest the hot sandwich here, just don't get the side.	neutral
This is a sureshot in Longueuil. When you want to be sure that everybody will find something they like, I take them here.I you have a dinner, I strongly suggest to site inside. The reason: to much traffic.The service is always good.	neutral
"Oh Magia... You haven't aged well my friend. About 10 years ago I spent a year living a few blocks away from Magia. This was my favorite local eatery within a 5 min walk. A decade later, on a whim, I decided to return. It was kinda like running into an ex you haven't seen in a long time. A little fun for the first few minutes... but you're really left with ""wow... What happened to her?"". Sure the implants and Botox have helped, but it's just masking what once was. The menu looks the same, but dementia has set in, they have forgotten how to make my old favorites. I started with the warm goat cheese salad. I used to dream of this salad at night! But what I got was, well, it was disheartening. Anyway... I won't be calling her back. It was too awkward, and I don't see it getting better over the next few years either."	neutral
The food was very delicious. The waitress couldn't speak english so she brought us someone who could translate the menu as well. She helped us a lot actually. The only problem was that the pizza we ordered, one slice was slightly wet. The crust was soggy as if it had been dipped in water. But it was only a corner of the crust so I don't know what it could've been. Aside from that everything was good.	good
It's a bit pricey, and the portions are small. I had bruschetta, it was yummy. I had the vegetarian risotto, which was amazing! I spent $60, and the waitress forgot about me, waited nearly 30 minutes for her to pick up my payment. I had two glasses of wine and I'm a light weight so I hadn't noticed that much time had pasted, the book I was reading kept me entertained.	good
Pros:- Great Food- Good Ambiance- Good ServiceCons:- Price- Portion on the petite side.	neutral
Pour un jeudi midi ensoleillé la terrasse du Magia n'était pas très occupée, surprenant... Inquiétant même. L'hôtesse n'a ma pas aidée a me rassurer mais la serveuse a été plus que charmante, mignonne, efficace et souriante. Le Virgin Ceaser et la bière rousse de mon invité étaient généreux et rafraîchissants. Ma salade italienne était goûteuse et croustillante, et les penne forestier délicieux!Seul hic sur la terrasse de gauche... Plusieurs guèpes alors... Peureux s'abstenir!!	good
In the city of Longueuil, which is across the water from Montreal in what is called the south shore area, is the quaint old town area of Longueuil. This little strip is dotted with little shops and restaurants, including this one, La Magia. The restaurant is in a sort of old house, with the front room cleared out for diners. The food is casual, and good for lunch, offering salads, pastas, and pizzas. I had a nice Spaghetti Pancetta, which included a nice side salad, for $11.95, very reasonable and done well. Service in the busy lunch hour was good, too.	neutral
We were the first couple to arrive of a party of 10.  The maitre-d' looked at us, nodded towards to the table and told us to seat ourselves.  Equally rude was the waiter who actually rolled his eyes at people who couldn't decide what to eat, and who got in a shouting match with one couple over whether a steak cooked 'medium' had any red in it.On top of that, the two people that ordered the sea bass were treated not only to some cheaper, tasteless fish in the guise of a bass but both were sick that night.I would highly recommend never going to this restaurant.	bad
A beautiful little restaurant with five-star-worthy food at very reasonable prices.I had the chicken with oyster mushroom sauce, and my wife had the flank steak with plum sauce. The lentil soup was hot, very tasty, and a nice start after coming in on a snowy night. The entrees were simply awesome. After sampling both dishes, we both preferred the chicken, but that's not to say anything negative about the steak. They were both rich and intensely flavorful. Finally, the pear and chocolate cake with raspberry sauce was a great end to a memorable meal.The service was good and the atmosphere was very cozy. This was easily the best meal we had on our trip to Montreal.	good
My husband and I had the best meal here. It is elegant, cozy and romantic, and the food is excellent. We had French onion soup,which was superb. I tried the duck confit,though I usually don't like duck. Boy was it great! Best of all, it is very reasonable. Loved it!	good
Wonderful service with a Parisian flair.  Incredible food. Reasonable price and beautiful location. Great place for a nice dinner out!!	good
Fries are burnt, the sole is frozen, the pastas are mushy, butter pasta for kids has peppers in it when you ask for 3 times for just butter. The waiter was nice, but the mediocrity of the food makes this an over priced proposition.	bad
I had the Pavé de saumon grillé, vinaigrette tiède à l'orange.  This is a grilled salmon dish that came with mixed vegetables and I believe orzo rice?  Everything was nicely seasoned.  The salmon was moist and flaky.  I saw some people getting a small sample of port.  I didn't get this when I was finished.  I guess you only get it if you order dessert.	good
The receipt we came home with says Restaurant Le Caveau, but the location is not that mentioned on the yelp site.  They might have two locations.  The one we visited was on 410 Place Jaques.  We were in the Old Montreal part of town on Saturday June 8 looking for a spot to eat.  It was the Grand Prix week-end so naturally a lot of places were full.  It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus.  Finally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters.  The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh.  I love seafood so we were sold.  Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision.  The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio.  There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.we ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.  They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain).On to mains.  Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon.  Both were awful.  the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour.  The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process.  The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty.VERDICT:::very pricey, food quality sub par, service left much to be desired. I am surprised we did not get sick. I would not go back if you paid me.	bad
* Nice included breakfast *Staying upstairs in the small yet lovely seven room Le Relais Lyonnaise (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hotel-le-relais-lyonnaise-montreal#hrid:tNEe9qqV1iexbFUbNqaS8g), the kind owner explained that he also operates this cafe, and that breakfast is included for guests in this public cafe.  (That was a nice bonus as when booking the room there was no mention of a free included breakfast.)  My review is only for the breakfast as I didn't come for any other meals or for the attractive selection of desserts in the displayed fridge (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=WVECS2J92y8C0xZqD2aA-g).  Every morning during my stay I had a bowl of cafe au lait and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=JIEPOJeoTRAPB0MBK5b_lwThe breakfasts were quite hearty and ranged from omelets (I had a nice cheese and herb omelet one day) to crepes to bagel with lox.  My favourite breakfast of the bunch turned out to be the bagel with lox.  They served a fresh bagel covered with a very generous amount of lox.  Cream cheese was served on the side, along with a side salad (typical mixed greens like from a market served with a nice dijon mustard based dressing) and some fresh fried potatoes (these were exceptionally tasty).  I've never had salad and potatoes with my breakfast bagel before, but it somehow worked and turned into my favourite breakfast offering at the cafe.  Here is a photo of it:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=8ldkGMWDtAFMo5NidT5EfAI like the whole idea of stepping out of your room, going outside and heading to a regular cafe, yet being able to order whatever you'd like from the menu.  Nice additional touch for staying at the hotel!	good
An OK spot to stop for breakfast. I'd say everything about it was pretty average.*Food (in our case an omelette and a savory Chicken Pesto Crepe) was good but not great. I think the omelette was probably the better choice here - my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy it. The buckwheat crepe, which is apparently what they're known for, didn't really do it for me. Also, skip the breakfast potatoes. These were bland.*Value - prices were a little high, but portions were very large. Two people with normal appetites could probably split a plate. If you're a full grown man you'll probably be able to tackle one on your own. *Service - very friendly, but not overly attentive. I'd maybe come back here if I stayed in the area again...but only if I couldn't find a better alternative.	neutral
Four stars might be a bit much, perhaps three and a half, if it were available, would be my ultimate rating. My mother, who used to work here in her younger days, swears by this place, and although it has changed considerably over the years, the care and technique put into the food is still there and you can taste it. While I wouldn't consider this place for dinner, it is the perfect early lunch/brunch spot. Nothing fancy, but damn good crepes, croque monsieur and the paninis are also quite good. Side salads are always fresh, excellent dressings, coffee is excellent, and the selection of desserts, chocolates and glaces are also wicked. As a chocolate chef, I can say the chocolate here is definitely worth a visit. Somewhat pricey for lunch-fare, but the portions are decent and the quality IS there. The service is sometimes cold, and it can get slow, but mostly you get what you pay for. Definitely a fan. Great terrasse as well.	good
I personally cannot agree with the earlier two reviewers of this place...I thought the food was quite good. I highly recommend the quiche and I have it on good authority that the sandwiches from this place are much better than NYC cartfood...I guess it all depends on your expectations, this place is French, not typical American.I recommend this place for breakfast or lunch...wouldn't really want to come here for dinner.	neutral
Their crepes are amazing, coffee is delicious. A place I visit regularly in Montreal. Nice atmosphere. I love to sit and take my time when I go out, my family is typically European, and Ive never experienced a problem with the wait staff. Would not come here for dinner however.	good
Meh, it was okay. Not the best food ever but not terrible	bad
The staff was very friendly and the service was pretty fast but everything we ate there was definitely under flavored and overcooked. We got the croque madame, deux oeufs (two eggs), and salmon omelette. The salmon didn't taste very fresh and the Croque Madame was pretty stale and merely a ham sandwich with an egg on top. Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it's not a restaurant I will probably go back to/recommend for people in Montreal.	bad
Pastries, sandwiches,light lunches. Terrasse outside behind patisserie. Late evening treat seekers beware; virtually nothing left by then.	good
"I've always made sure to stop by here for dinner at least once during my annual trip to Montréal.  Usually I'll order a crêpe dish while the boyfriend would go for the quiche du jour, all complimented with a pitcher of Boréale Blonde.  Everything's generally good and we pretty much get our fill, but we always save room for dessert.  The rum balls are huge but tasty.  Other personal faves are the doudou and plugastel, if I remember the spelling correctly.  It's good anyway.  Service is so-so.  This is the type of resto where you'll want to dine if you're not in a hurry, since the staff is a little bit on the ""taking their time"" side.  Maybe that's just the rushed American in me."	neutral
Their buckwheat crepes are fantastic  - huge and delicious. You  won't leave this place hungry!	good
I have been here a few times but admittedly not in a couple of years.  So Yanik might be right that the quality has gone down in.  That said, this place has been my go to spot for croissants and coffee when I'm in Montreal.  I am very picky about my croissants, they need to use only butter and lots of it.  No margerine.  Good ones are hard to find.  So I would go have my croissants and coffee and read the local papers.  I cant speak to the lunch menu.	neutral
This place used to be a very good spot in Montréal. When I was student, I went there many times per week. At that time it was only a place where you drink coffe (expresso machine, of course) and eat pastries. The choice was astonishing and they were made by highly skilled people using the very best ingredient. Today, you can go there for a whole meal, not just café and dessert but the atmosphere is not the same anymore. The place has been sold and the original owner (a French lady) is not there to keep the place up to the very high standards that used to be. Yes, now you can enjoy salad, croque-monsieur and soups, they even have added the ice cream to the menu, but each time I go there (2 or 3 times per year), I see that this place is just a shadow of what it used to be.	bad
"ARGHHHHHHHHHH   We only ended up here cos it was listed in ""Montreal's Top 25"" guidebook.  (Do people who write these guide books actually eat at the places they review?!!!!)   Dont bother going to this place - cos if you walked a little further up, there are tons of better looking places with better looking food.The service here was slow.  They took FOREVER to take our orders.  The food was not worth waiting for.  The soup of the day felt so thin that it was as if someone had just poured water into a pot of leftovers.  You could get better sandwiches off a street cart in New York.   They took FOREVER to give us our check.  Nuff said.  ARGHHHHHHHHHHHDont waste your time here.  We hopped onto the subway to find this place because it was on the recommended list.  Dont do it!!!   We did and we regret it till this day..........."	bad
I was staying at hotel a few blocks away. It was our first night in Montreal and it was beautiful. We came here and sat on the terrace. I had a smoked salmon panini and it was delicious. The meal came with a large salad as well. The food wasn't the most amazing ever, but it was good enough and really it was the atmosphere that I enjoyed the most.	good
I might be being generous, but the crepes hit the spot after walking all over old Montreal. Crepe, salad and cold local beer. Outside sitting, people watching on St. Denis. Stayed for a pastry and coffee. All were very good.	good
Un bel endroit pour des crêpes tard le dimanche matin ou pour désert/café en fin de soirée (pâtisseries fancy, chocolat, glace ).Paninis, quiches, salade (La Lyonnaise est pour homme averti) pour lunch et souper. Frais, bon prix, bon service, chaleureux à l'intérieur malgré le bruit de la prép. des cafés évidemment!Un bon alternatif à désert sur St-Denis si votre resto du moment n'offre rien a votre goût! :-)	neutral
Walking down St. Denis is an experience within itself.  You might get swept up in the romance that is Montreal and innocently assume that all restaurants on the street are going to be delicious and serve quality cuisine.  This is not always true.  Sure, the atmosphere helps, and the cafe diners on the front patio appear to be enjoying themselves.  But, once you taste the food being served, you may not be sold.They serve fresh squeezed juice, so everyone at the table ordered it.  Not realizing that we just spent almost $20 on juice even before ordering food.  The fabulous looking bread and pastry counter is not filled with items made in house, but made elsewhere.  Instead I was served a decent croissant, but nothing worth mentioning.The worst part of the meal were the buckwheat crepes.  We had buckwheat crepes a few days before at a different restaurant across the street and loved them.  So, we thought that experience could be continued at Brioche Lyonnaise.  We were mistaken.  The room temperature, floppy sponge crepes given to us were not fresh and had barely any fillings.  Nor were they served with a side of anything appetizing to try to make up for their mistakes.  The chicken inside of the chicken pesto crepe was cold and dry, and barely any cheese to soften the blow.   I simply could not eat the dish, and everyone else that the table felt the same about their dishes.  The worst part is that the brunch for three people was $70 CAD.  It was a tragedy!	bad
My wife said the brioche wasn't genuine and was in fact just pain au raisin. Either way it was OK. But not mouth watering. We had crepes as well...which were...well crepe like. Pretty hard to go wrong with this stuff. The cafe au lait was very nice indeed though. Service was quick and the waitress very pleasant. A good place to go for a snack and a coffee, but nothing special. We were a little disappointed as our guide book said this was the best brioche in Montreal and we kind of went out of our way to get here.	neutral
Never have I walked out of a restaurant refusing to pay because of bad food. NEVER. Until now.We were in a hurry so stupidly decided to just go for lunch in the first non-chain restaurant we found on St Denis. BIG MISTAKE. I sort of blame myself as if I had actually looked at this place more clearly I would have noticed how grimy and dirty the outside was. It was also completely empty despite there being hoardes of people in local competitors.Service started out a bit weird. I asked if they had iced coffee (not on the menu) and the server replied: ''I could make you one I suppose''....Odd. Anyway, I ordered an iced latte as well the french toast with fruit and my bf ordered the croque monsieur.I went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were. The bathroom stank!! Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag. I then saw him put it in a microwave in the grotty kitchen. $11. French toast. MICROWAVED?!Stupidly, I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and didn't say anything. My iced latte arrived. It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE. Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed. When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink. It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED.The food arrived. The french toast was as gross as it looked in that plastic bag. It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE. the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut. My bf is NOT a fussy eater, but took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''. We were both that appalled. We eat out a lot, and have travelled a lot, eating in all sorts of restaurants, and this was the first time either of us ever left any restaurant anywhere because we were so disgusted with the food quality.What was most interesting was that neither the servers nor the manager were particularly shocked when we said we were leaving and refused to pay. They didn't even protest, offer us anything else or defend themselves for charging $11 for microwaved french toast. After asking us for a bit of clarification, they simply said ''sorry, ok'' and shrugged their shoulders. I think that says a lot - I got the impression we were not the first customers to have done this recently.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We really should have just gone into the Subway next door.	bad
Worst crepes ever. Lack of stuffings. Lack of taste. Lack of service. My wife took the pork chops... same thing. How can you miss a pork chop. And the fries looked like McCain's fries. Overcooked. Oh well, that was the last time.	bad
Before I put in my 2 cents in without considering that I was in fact, in another country, I will review about the food first.-Crepe: I had the ratatouille with mushrooms, egg, and tomato paste. It is wrapped and presented in the most beautiful way. The taste was not so great, but this could have been a result of me eating it cold on my drive back down to NY so I will forgive and forget.-Desserts: I cannot list all of the desserts I have tried here, because that would be an entirely long list. Just as delicious as they look, they ARE in fact, delicious. I am not a big fan of desserts that are too sweet, so I had to appreciate the lightness and subtlety of the fruit tarts. Perfect for bringing back gifts for family and friends.Service is a hit or miss depending on the waitress. Bear in mind that they take orders, prepare the food, AND serve it. I initially wondered whether the mediocre service was because of cultural differences, but I just realize that it wasn't and that this place is just poppin' and busy as can be. No doubt about this though...people are nice and helpful in Montreal..a very nice change from the city life.	good
"J'entre frigorifiée dans ce café dans lequel j'avais brunché avec des amis, il y a 3 ans. Je commande un café au lait et deux macarons. Je croque dans le 1er, il est congelé. Le 2nd, pareil. Quand je me plains -poliment- à la serveuse, elle s'excuse et emporte mon assiette. ""Ici, on sert les macarons congelés"", revient-elle me dire. Et de me proposer de les ""réchauffer,... un peu...au micro-ondes"""	bad
"Getting hassled about whether or not you work ""in the industry"" puts customers off and completely awkward. ""Where do you work?"" ""In what city?"" ""What did you do?""The answer is, ""none of your fucking business."" Don't have ""industry night"" if you aren't going to extend deals to everyone... or at least be consistent about it. Quality and consistency are the only things I ask.The ""Acoustic Blues"" starts at 8. It's really more of the acoustic rather than the blues portion of that phrase, and is also played on an electric guitar....and if that doesn't make any sense at all, then you just need to go visit The Western on a Sunday, because by god can Sarah Robinson sing. Quite the set of pipes. Her other counterparts were impressive too."	bad
What the new Dierks Bentley bar SHOULD be.  I was so happy to get here after trying out that whiskey bar.  This place is what you'd expect, complete with a red curtained stage.  The band when I went was AMAZING and I wouldn't say I'm the biggest fan of cover bands.  They played NEW country and it was great!  I'm telling all my friends to go!	good
Let's talk food.  Started with the wings and they were very good.  Ordered the ribs for dinner.  They were not so tender and the flavor is just not that great, to me. The cole slaw fell flat.  No zest, no zing, flavor just not so great.  The fries were great.  Husband ordered the Steer Here sandwich and said it was pretty good, but he also was not a fan of the slaw.  Atmosphere was good but we left before the live music started.	neutral
The Western is a fun new spot located on 5th Ave just west of Goldwater. Live country bands, a dance floor, dim lights, good food, and cheap drinks made for an interesting evening. I have a feeling that The Western will be with us for awhile. Live music every Wednesday thru Sunday with NO COVER.	good
I had dinner at this establishment while waiting to attend a show at Stand-up Comedy. Being the country girl that I am, I was in heaven! The layout is western through and through. A band was setting up, but unfortunately I didn't get to hear them. The staff were all very pleasant.I ordered the Cobb salad with chicken. Nothing spectacular... It is a bar you know. I will go back though, there are other things on the menu that I would like to try. Plus, it seems like a very fun, toe-tapping place to get ya booty-scoot boogying on! Plan ahead for parking.	good
I'll start with the good.  The bar staff were awesome.  I overheard someone complaining about lipstick on her glass, they gave her a new drink and for the next two hours we watched the bar back hand polish the other glasses.   I ordered the jalapeño poppers and the were delicious (but not for those adverse to heat).  The muddled cocktails were expertly prepared.  The band played covers but they were well performed and there was no cover charge.  I'll say again, live music in Phoenix with no cover charge.So why only four stars?  It's a Scottsdale cowboy bar on the verge of becoming a legit cowboy bar.  They need to replace the horseshoes game horseshoe above the door with a real horseshoe from a real horse.  Have a little respect.	good
Short review: Awful service, awful drinks. Super long wait at the non-crowded bar while I had the pleasure of watching the male bartender flirt with the female waitstaff for over 5 minutes. No acknowledgement or apologies from the staff for severely sub-par service. Detailed review: The service is just plain awful. I've been a few times now before deciding to finalize my opinion and write a review, and after my last visit this past weekend I'm compelled to warn people to stay away if you're looking for a place with anything resembling even mediocre service. I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order. It was not busy, and there is no excuse for the wait - I had to watch the male bartender flirt and laugh with the female waitstaff the entire time. He never made eye contact or even bothered to acknowledge my presence the entire time I waited. When he finally came over, it was after he took the order and brought beers for the guy who stood next to me, and had only just recently ponied up to the bar about a minute previously. When I finally got my drink order (a very simple whisky cocktail and a draught PBR) the cocktail ended up being one of the worst I've ever had in my life. I don't understand how someone could mess up a simple cocktail so badly - I even asked a few friends to try it to make sure I wasn't overreacting. Their disgusted looks after they each took a sip proved me right. My experiences at this place in the past were warning enough, but after this last visit I will never go back.	bad
Great place for country music in old town!	good
When you get tired of DJ's and electronic music and you're ready for some authentic music made by actual musicians, this is the place for you.The minute you walk in you realize that this isn't some honky tonk dive, this is a very dark, classy place, with a large bar and plenty of seating. The stage is well appointed and there's even an area next to the stage that looks to be a VIP lounge.This is the type of place that you would normally find in NYC, LA or Nashville, so its a great addition to Scottsdale. It reminds me of the type of place where you might have found Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, or George Jones taking the stage back in the day. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if this becomes the place where national musicians go to play a few unannounced sets when they are in town.Gotta say, in just one visit The Western has become my favorite new place in town.	good
Cool hidden gem! Great place to come to have awesome drinks with your friends and listen to some country music! Cool decorations and fun atmosphere! The bar top is awesome so check it out! They also have awesome customer service! The bar tender Dave is an awesome guy and really knows his stuff! He always has a great attitude and a smile on his face which makes for a great visit! Keep up the awesome work Dave! Come check out the Western for a fun time with great people	good
Super lame, super pretentious.  Bartenders were were not very helpful, did not provide quick service, and left a lot to be desired.  We paid a $10 cover for a band that was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The liquor selection was good, with top shelf whiskeys, ryes, and vodkas, an adequate scotch selection, and fairly good beer selection.  It was a fun atmosphere but the cover was unacceptable and more than anything else the service was crap.  Save your money and go and support bartenders somewhere else.	bad
Loved this place! Saw a band play and had delicious food. My only complaint was having to flag down the waitress for EVERY request. In her defense, the place was buzzing.. But we wouldn't even see her for 30 mins at a time. Pulled pork sliders with pineapple slaw, onion rings, fries, and drinks are TASTY!	good
Great atmosphere and music. I am so happy they brought back the guitar player during Friday Happy Hours.  The food is awesome and the bartenders are very friendly and attentive.I go there once to twice a week, but always Fridays.	good
Pretty unique spot in Old Town.   Live country music and dancing.  Bring your boots and have fun!	good
"We walk in and nu-metal is blaring from the speakers. That wasn't even the worst part. Went here for a free show--a touring band from Norway. The band was good, sound was good, vibe was good--until I walked up to the bar. I appeared to be interrupting something when I walked up. I then asked the female bartender how much the well drinks were and she said $5 as if she was already annoyed with me. I then asked her what a buckshot was (since that was the $1 special on the board.) She didn't have a straight answer and instead asked the male bartender, ""it's uh whatever we feel like making, we'll start with whiskey?"" I ordered it, what the hell, YOLO. Big mistake--the ""buckshot"" tasted like cough medicine and corn syrup. Before my order was complete the male and female bartender are snickering with each other as if they are sharing their own private joke. I seriously felt like I was transported back to middle school--who does that? I got the feeling that these two weren't happy with the crowd nor the band--but that shouldn't really matter. The crowd was there drinking (and tipping) these two because of the band. Why the attitude? Before the band's set was over the male bartender starts cleaning up the venue, pushing chairs in (loudly) and collecting glasses from tables. The lead singer says into the microphone ""are we being kicked out?"" to which she gets no response. The male bartender and female bartender appeared to be flirting with one another in the back corner, laughing at customers, etc. I definitely wasn't the only one that was feeling uncomfortable. These two bartenders were not only chasing the crowd away but also the headlining band. The venue itself had a cool vibe (aside from the nu-metal blaring in between sets), the prices were slightly more than average ($5 for a draft beer, $5 for a well drink, $1 for a ""buckshot"") and the service, well the service was non-existence. I felt like the duo was put out by my presence. Word of advice if you are the duo reading this--if your income is highly dependent upon tips, you should probably be nicer to the 20 or so people that are actually in your bar on a Monday night instead of driving them (and the band they came to see) away."	bad
I haven't eaten here...only came for a Friday night out on two separate occasions. Great live music and reasonable priced drinks. Love it here!	good
"This is so my kind of place. I'm not even what you'd consider a ""country girl"" but the laid back, fun-loving scene with tasty beer, grub and music is totally my style. For some reason I've seem to be into taking my cowboy boots everywhere and have fallen in love with the western scene, so I like to drag my kicks out on the dance floor for some dancin. The live music is great and people are totally down to boogie. Not in the bump n gridn kinda way you see all over Old Town, but in the get your ugly funk on kinda way.The food is definitely southwestern comfort food. Not a whole lot in the way of meatless fare, but I've only eaten here once. The deep fried grilled cheese was, well...exactly what you'd expect. Pretty good. Love me some shoestring fries and I could probably just have those for a whole meal. The jalapeno mac n cheese was surprisingly spicy in a good way. Beer and wine selections are both terrific. This spot is totally becoming a regular weekend hangout!"	good
Taco tuesday is awesome! It's a little off the beaten path in old town and the type of people that come here seem to be good people. One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale both because of the service, tacos, Shiner, and the very cool look of the place.	good
This place is a hidden gem!  You cannot get live honky tonk music like this anywhere close.  Did I say LIVE music? yes, I did. We went there on a Saturday night, I guess the weekend it opened. It is next to the Scottsdale Comedy Club, which by the way if you have not tried, must go!. The place is small but they had a full bar, nice décor and great service.  So it won me over.  Must try the Texas Frito Nachos.  so good.  the hush puppies lack flavor, but I'm not a fan of hush puppies in general. My companions liked them, then again if you're drunk, anything fried is good.  They have a small dance floor in front of the stage, so bring your cowboy boots and start two-steppin!  The only criticism I can make is the place is small and it would have been nice if there was a patio to get away for some air.  I'd go back to enjoy the live music, drinks and try out their menu which is quite good in price.	good
"Great Venue, Good Food, Terrible Service.Short Review: We were completely ignored, waited forever to get our food order taken and I had to take up my soda to the bar to get a refill.Long Review: We were planning on going out to eat before getting to The Western, but after hitting traffic we thought we'd play it safe and just eat at the venue. We had never been, so when we arrived at 7:00 we thought the doors would be open to serve food, but when they say doors open and 7:30, they open at 7:30. As we were waiting outside, 7:30 rolled around and we were told the doors would be opening at 7:45 instead. Okay, fine, we were hungry but we could wait. 7:45, doors didn't open. 8:00, doors didn't open. Finally around 8:15, 15 minutes after the show was suppose to start we got in and we grabbed one of the first tables we saw, right at the front near the stage. We sat down and were handed menus pretty quickly. A waitress came around and asked if we'd been helped, we said no and ordered a Coke (which was 90% ice) and PBR. We then mentioned that we'd be ordering food tonight. Then about a minute later another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said yes and assumed they a communication or organizational issue. About 5 minutes later a bartender brought over our drinks and we started noticing food being brought out to the booths behind us. We overheard the people behind us get asked if they wanted food to eat twice, yet our waitress walked right by us. We tried several times to flag someone down, but the opening band had already begun to play so it was difficult to get anyone's attention. After being ready for 15 minutes, and watching everyone else get their food orders, our waitress came back and we finally got our order in. I don't remember the specifics but we got the grilled cheese and a burger. We got our food about 5 minutes later, which was okay, nothing special. At that point we were so hungry would have been happy if they just brought us over some Taco Bell. About halfway through the meal, we both ran out of drinks, down to the last drop of watered down Coke. We began another round of find your waitress as our food got cold. And once again she walked past a few times. After about 5 minutes of trying I just gave up and walked over to the end of the bar with my empty glass. Our waitress walked over to the bar and since the bartender was busy I asked her for another Coke and PBR. She replied with a cheery, ""Sure! I'll bring that right over!"" I guess she didn't find it strange that I was trying to get my own refill. She brought over our drinks and we finished our meal. Then the fastest service we got was her bringing us the bill. Maybe we picked a bad table. Maybe we picked a hectic night. All I know is I may be back to see a show, but I definitely will be eating somewhere else beforehand."	bad
Very. Good brisket, quest, and burger. The ambiance is very dark but pleasant. There is a good sound system and entertainment many nights. There is a nice dance floor for when dancing is available; most of the recorded music is certainly good for dancing county and western.	good
Like many others have said, great place to get away from the usual old town hustle. Can be loud at times but Sunday's w/ Sara Robinson are awesome. Most of their musicians are good and the staff has always been friendly. Hope they keep the enthusiasm going!	good
Came here to see Dax Riggs one weeknight. Got here pretty late because I had to break away/talk my way out of a social obligation before driving over. So the doorman told me I missed a few songs of his set and right when I was about to pay, the woman running the show told him they're not taking any more money at the door. I guess they were closing the books or whatever - so I got in free. SCORE! So I headed to the stage area to watch the band and boy what a cluster. Place was already packed to the gills with folks and there wasn't a whole lot of room to expand outward since there are mostly tables once you pass the main floorspace. Sound was decent - it was just a duo with no drumkit so that would have been hard to mess up. Can't complain because I didn't pay a cent for the whole experience and didn't even bother to get a drink. Managed to skip the openers and see just what I wanted. Not a bad venue but it probably works best for local acts with a smaller audience given the small space. Parking isn't too much of a problem even if it's crowded - you can keep driving E. 5th avenue until you see some open parking spots. I found a space just before I hit Goldwater Blvd.	neutral
Great live music and atmosphere. wings were excellent, but portion size was small. I would have liked to see 10 wings as opposed to 8, since the charge was equivalent to the burgers. For dessert we had the apple cobbler which was amazing. I would definitely order that again. The service was excellent. All of the staff were very friendly and quick.	good
I wound up here after taking a life-threatening, drunken jaywalk across Indian School from The Valley Ho. Needless to say, I made it safely across (and back) and had a GREAT time. It's definitely one of the more genuine country places you'll find in The Valley and definitely at the top of my list for taking in some live music.They pull off the rustic, country decor well and they have a country/chuck wagon inspired menu to boot. I did not sample the food I just knocked back a few beers courtesy of the friendly, efficient bar staff who took good care of me and helped contribute further to my state of inebriation.It's really the anti- Dierks Bentely's Whiskey Row: you'll find a more mature, well-behaved crowd and a more mellow environment more conducive to having fun than seeing and being seen.This is equally good to come for drinks and eats as it is for drinking and tearing up the dance floor so I am looking forward to coming back soon and getting my two-step on	good
Love this place. Great food, good beers, fried oreos! Had the wings and a burger this time. Not terribly busy for dinner but should be if you ask me.  Service was outstanding and if we were in the mood we would have stayed for the music that was setting up during dinner.  Great non-stereotypical Scottsdale scene for Scottsdale.	good
Just spent a few hours here and it was a fine place. They had a country band playing on Wednesday and they were decent enough if you like that music. Some good happy hour beer deals - i believe domestics were $2.50, although they never gave me the 50 cent change. It's like they undercharged me - strange. Tried the nachos and they were a fairly big portion loaded with ground beef and lots of black beans and sour cream. The sauce was a cheese sauce, not real melted cheese. Another gorgeous bartender was patrolling behind the bar as well. Not crowded at happy Hour. Kind of hidden away on 5th - they need a bright sign or something.	neutral
I'm not usually one for writing reviews but The Western is definitely worthy! Staff was friendly, prompt, and knew the menu. The server (was quizzed)  had great recommendations... and, and, the sound system for their performers is great. It's off the beaten path, but that's a good thing in my opinion.	good
Food is lousy mainly because waitress does not listen . Music is great but eat elsewhere first. Even trying to fix errors the food is only less then fair. Have not eaten in 9 hours so very hungry and still skipped much of it. Need better wait staff and kitchen	bad
This is a fun addition to Old Town! Situated in a hidden street just away from the hustle and bustle of Old Town, classy cowboys are welcomed into this new country establishment. It's not your typical honky tonk bar though. No here the lights are dim, the decor is country chic and the vibe is country classy. I especially like the live bands they have and the dance floor that invites visitors to enjoy the music. I have yet to try the food but plan on Doug so very soon and will report back.	good
I stopped here for my friend's birthday last night and really had one of the best nights out i've had in a while. For not paying a cover, the band here was fantastic. They had people on the dance floor all night. The dance floor is a pretty good size for people to have fun and move. The drinks were delicious and very reasonably priced. I noticed a small little section of the restaurant right off the dance floor that looked like it was reserved for a private party. I would highly recommend checking it out if you have a birthday or bachelorette or something coming up in the future. It seemed pretty private but right off the stage and dance floor so you're still part of all the action. The service was also pretty fast and on top of things. This is definitely a place I will come back to!	good
"Don't go here for the food or the service! If you like to drink and country music then this can be fun. The food is mediocre and service really really slow. It took an hour and a half for me to get a kale chicken caesar salad. And when it came there was no kale and when I asked the waitress she said they took it off the menu. Thanks for telling me that when I placed my order from their menu with that salad on it. Hmmm. And my sister's burger was suppose to have a fried egg on top.  When they served it they forgot to tell her they ran out of eggs. Okay..... Wtf!  They should just shut the kitchen down and serve drinks with the live bands. The rest of the food in my group was bland and the manager comped the food because ""they couldn't handle"" business with another party of 75. Our group was six people. Not our problem!  There are way too many fantastic places to eat in Scottsdale. We don't need this lame excuse for food! If they stay in business it will truly only be due to the music and drinks. Scottsdale!! This is your official WARNING! Don't eat at The Western! Your welcome."	bad
Love this place! Great live music with no cover.  Does it get much better?!  The dance floor is on the small side, but I have enjoyed cutting a rug here many nights.  The bar is awesome and made of textured leather, and they have some delicious mixed drinks if you are in the mood for something a little different.	good
Fried pickles and Ranch! I love this place. I can't wait to try the free dance lessons on Wednesday nights. The food is delicious and the vibe is so laid back and welcoming. I love that it's a bit outside of the busy nightlife area of old town/ downtown scottsdale. Everyone who works at The Western is really nice and the live music is great. get the fried pickles, a burger and one of their awesome drinks and enjoy.	good
Pretty neat little country bar/ resurtant...I stopped in here on a random Friday night. They had quite a few people here. The place smelled delicious like home made BBQ! It has a cool small town country bar feel, that I havn't felt since being back at my small home town. There was a pretty decent sized dance floor with a live country band. Lots of people having tons of fun and country dancing! I was also happy to hear that they were have great drink specials. $2 bottled beers. Awesome! I will definitely be visiting this place again in the future! Lots of fun here!	good
If you have ever dreamed of an heirloom tomato salad with chicken, it's from here.I'm obsessed--I'm quietly pining for it now.As far as live music goes, this place has two flavors: their usual, western-type stuff or outside-promoted shows like Saintseneca, Say Hi/Big Scary, Shakey Graves, etc. I have only been here on the latter-type of night and it was always great.If you manage your expectations appropriately, you will always have a good time. Check ahead about the music if you're a snob either way.Love the community tables, love the bison head, love the wallpaper, love the stage, love Eric the bartender, LOVE.	good
Deeds makes the best Butter Chicken in the world!  Find Flavor Chalet and try it, you will not be disappointed!  5 stars every time!  Love it!	good
Flavor Chalet was one of the food tracks being served at the Capital Lawn. I order a side of french fries and grilled cheese. The large image behind the truck and his whiteboard suggested fresh thin cut fries. But the fries he was setting up was from a frozen bag and they weren't thin cut at all, just large soft fries that he had to prepare the oil to deep fried them on. He also took a long time just getting prepared to make my grilled cheese. In short, he was very disorganized and at least 3 people who were waiting on him to take new orders, left. He spend almost 10min working on my food, he didn't bother to take new orders. He was the only person running the truck. The fries were bad as expected and the grilled cheese tasted funky. He didn't used american sliced cheese, but used shredded cheese. He also used 2 regular size breads you get at Fry's. For these two orders, I paid $12.50. In addition, his idea of curry meal on the whiteboard showed a large plate nicely prepared with the toppings. I saw a guy ordering it and he got a small Styrofoam bowl with some premade curry served in it. That cost him $6. Took a total of 20min to get my order. I would avoid this place.	bad
Absolutely disgusting.Microwavable food.Swindles you to pay for something that you didn't order.False Advertising. Avoid at all costs!	bad
"This was the worst experience at a food truck ever! All of the ""Specials of the day"" items that he had displayed on his white board were not available. He was out of everything! He heated up one last hamburger patty (not fresh) for my young daughter and put the patty on a stale hot dog bun! No lettuce, no tomatoes, etc. I asked for a plain bean & cheese burrito for my other young daughter and he put rice & curry in it! Hello?! what part of PLAIN beans & cheese did he not understand! He then wanted to charge me FULL price for my order plus the burrito and hotdog hamburger. I told him that it was not a fair price and he was arguing with me about it- I will never eat here again and I will let many friends know about this experience!"	bad
I stubled across this place on Leith Walk by chance as it isn't obviously signed nor is it well established yet in the area.  It's aiming for a fresh, Mediterranean feel as the owners are Italian.  Inside it's clean and light with a small number of tables and an impressive deli counter with fresh ingredients.  The service is friendly and the menu offers a good selection of cakes, sandwiches and Italian specialities like pizzas, calzones and pasta dishes.  I had a ham and pineapple pizza which only took about five minutes to be prepared and tasted amazing.  The base was nice and crisp and the topping was delicious with good quality cheese.  Not only was it tasty, but it was filling too and only cost £4.It's a shame Elm Rose doesn't do more business as it offers friendly, quick service and great food at reasonable prices.	good
Whilst out and about today, I stumbled across this little cafe, situated on Elm Row at the Calton Hill end.  I decided to give it a try, and was not disappointed.The inside is small, with around 5 or 6 tables set out, each with a couple of chairs.  The right hand wall was occupied by a drinks chiller, with a chiller doubling as a counter at the back.  They serve the normal cafe range of items - drinks, small cakes, and no doubt paninis and sandwiches as well.Staff greeted me with a smile, and though I only bought one small piece of cake, I would love to be able to go back and sample some more of their food.  I find the shops on Elm Row are so easy to miss, as they are set back from the road, but if you venture in, you'll find gems like this.This is the sort of handy little place you'll want to keep coming back to.  First impressions can be everything, and they ticked the boxes for me.	good
"Elm Rose, with its neat Rennie Mackintosh styling, offers good quality soup, sandwiches and other lunchtime treats. It's well worth a visit, next time you're in the neighbourhood.Overall, we said: ""Elm Rose was pretty good. I don't think they're offering anything too outstanding, but it's a place I'd happily pop in, next time I'm passing. There's much to be said for places that keep things smart and simple, and that's the category into which Elm Rose neatly fits."""	good
This cafe, recently bought over from an Italian (no surprises here!) has the most tempting counter of food! Situated on Elm Row, I would personally rather grab a bite here to go, or eat at home, as it is quite small but the quality of the food can't be questioned!The staff were extremely friendly, and a woman who worked there assured me there'd be a change of menu by the following week if she could be bothered! I appreciate the numerous specials boards outside the cafe, as the food changes quite often and doesn't start to bore the customers.They've got a clever lay out, as they offer ciabatas, baked potatoes, baguettes, wraps and rolls which can be finished off with any fillings you choose yourself from the counter! The baked potato with chicken filling I had was really good, and to top it off, they are quite cheap as well.	good
The place was empty, but the staff(owners?) did not seem happy to see customers when the 5 of us walked in. They had trouble understanding English and didn't seem to remember what the ingredients were and kept referencing the menu while making our paninis. My chicken panini was all bread with almost no chicken except a few paper thin scraps. I think maybe they were getting ready to close and didn't want to cook anymore so they gave me what was left.	bad
Good place to grab a bite.  A colleague raved about their baked potatoe which I tried and was positively stuffed!  Had a Mexican wrap today, which came with salad and coleslaw.  Tasted great, would recommend as also have prompt service.	good
I found this lovely little café on route to a yoga class on a sunny Saturday morning, desperate for some caffeine and a minimal breakfast which would complain if I spent lots of time bending over and touching my toes! Elm Row Café and Diner is filled with personality, every wall covered with interesting things. There is a well stacked bookshelf in the corner by the counter, and a world map on the wall by the door with a request to 'pin where you've travelled'. It has a few tables but still feels small enough to be comfy in you are there on your own. I struggled to make my mind up but ended up with an Americano and some yoghurt coated raisins which were very satisfactory. The menu was vast though, featuring a variety of hot and cold snacks, and even Turkish coffee!	good
A good place for a lunch bite.  They have a few small tables and plenty of sandwiches, salads and soups to choose from.  I liked the buffalo chicken wraps, the falafel and the soups.    I found myself going back there a few times when I was staying in Edinburgh recently because the owners were friendly and the food was very good and freshly made.	good
I stopped here to meet a friend for a quick coffee and cake session, and I was surprised to see it because I have passed the place loads of times and just never noticed it.This is a wee traditional caff, selling lunch food like paninis, toasties and a selection of hot meals. The cakes were superb- my scone with jam and cream was divine coupled with a cup of milky tea- heaven or what?It was a cute and comfortable place to sit, and even though it was small we never felt rushed to leave. It was pretty inexpensive too, and I would most definitely come back for something more substantial.	good
"This is the closest Tim Horton near my house and I have been going there for the past 5 years. The food is the usual fast food but I always go since it's close and the service were good.However, it all changed when they changed the manager from the older male manager to a new small female asian manager. The old manager is very patient and very chatty and friendly but this new manager is very impatient and rude to customers. I was there to order the new grilled bagel and she at first mistaken that I wanted a bagel. When I cleared it up so that she has to make a modification on the order, everyone can hear her muttering ""oh god..."". Then I specifically asked for a combo and when she gave me the food, there is no hush brown. When I ask her about it, she just said annoyingly that she did not charge me and walked away.As a client, I can accept mistakes in the order as long as everything is clarified, either make the order right and charge me for the difference or apologize and let me know there isn't much she can do about it. However, her behavior is not setting a good example to the other employees and I sincerely hope that they change the manager for this store."	bad
Terrible service! Muffins were stale and they would not return my money.The French fries were the worst I have ever eaten. They also let children run around and play and yell.  Coffee is good and hot though.I will go back to TH, just not this one.	bad
"I usually come here before work on weekends and pick up a hot chocolate and a crate of TimBits. Service is a little slow, and they never have enough Timbits ti fill out my box, they only have the ""leftovers"" of the jelly filled once, which I try and avoid. They lack donut selection, like there is not enough, or they are already out of stock at 8am. I grab and go, its cheap and good, just missing the selection!"	neutral
Délicieux, copieux, personnel agréable, prix raisonnables, l'endroit idéal pour bruncher, prendre le petit dej ou dejeuner!Ne prend pas de réservation, donc prévoir un petit peu d'attente si vous n'arrivez pas tôt.	good
This is a very average breakfast restaurant. They don't do anything bad, but they don't blow you away either. If I had to complain, I would say that they pack the place a little too tight with the tables.	neutral
inexpensive doesn't have to mean gross. that place hasn't been cleaned in ages, the baskets hanging from the ceiling are so dustry, it makes me want to vomit. the food is diner-quality and their cooked apples are gross (plus i hate cooked apples). it's small and stuffy and reminds me of a dirty grandmother's house. They need to renovate and revamp the menu. the only reason they're still open is because Montreal has loads of cheapos.	bad
Great place for brunch, very intimate seating. Great meals with clearly very fresh ingredients. A gem of Plateau.	neutral
The food's pretty good, and there are lots of options, although it has a bit of that all-tasting-the-same problem that sometimes happens at brunch places.Also, be prepared to wait in line and then feel kind of crowded when you're eating.	neutral
Ah! Les restos à déjeuner!  On se demande toujours pourquoi les gens aiment faire la ligne le samedi matin à seule fin de se faire servir des oeufs-bacon, avec une tranche de melon et deux rondelles de banane...  À la base, donc, on ne peut pas dire que je suis fan de ce genre d'endroit... Néanmoins, si on devait éliminer 90% de ce genre de restaurant, je pense que je voudrait que la grand-mère poule demeure.  Pourquoi ?  D'abord parce qu'il y a au moins moyen, chez eux, de manger autre chose que les éternels oeufs-crêpe-pain dorés.  J'aime beaucoup, personnellement, les röstis, galettes de pommes de terre rapées, agrémentées de fromage, d'olive, de tomate, de bacon, ou autre selon celle que l'on choisit.  Ils font aussi d'excellentes pancakes à l'avoine.  Les portions sont généreuses et les prix très convenables.Pourquoi pas une étoile de plus alors ?Parce qu'ils ne savent pas faire un expresso convenable (et c'est vraiment le MOINS qu'on puisse dire).  Évitez tout ce qui ressemble à un expresso, cappucino, café au lait  en cet endroit (en tous cas, si vous aimez le café).  À titre d'exemple, quand j'ai commandé un expresso double très très court, on m'a apporté une bonne demi-tasse d'eau de vaisselle.  On m'a expliqué que c'était le plus court que la machine pouvait faire...  Merde, c'est au moins 8 fois trop d'eau!  Changez de machine!Leur filtre, quoique manquant un peu de concentration, est bon à sa façon.  Vaut mieux s'en tenir à ça...Mais tout de même, pour un resto à déjeuner, ne pas pouvoir faire un café décent...	neutral
A very good place for brunch. They have a lot a choices and it's inexpensive. The place is very cute and decorated like a farm. I had eggs florentine on english muffins and smoked salmon with a hollandaise sauce. It comes with hash-brown potatoes and sweet & warm apples. The bill was less than $12.	good
"Telle une couche-tard, lève-tard, j'ai pris aujourd'hui et pour la première fois.. Un brunch!!! Trop génial ce resto! Il propose des sortes de gros mégas bons ""petits-dej"" jusqu'à 15h!!Pour ma part je me suis laissée prendre par un ""jamais d'oeufs sans toi"" et je me suis régalée!!! Le service, l'ambiance, la deco! Tout au top, j'adore! Je recommande fortement ;)"	good
Well if you need coffee, its as you would expect at Tims. The line up is always big and the service is very slow for a Tims.	bad
This is one of the worst Tim Horton's I have ever been to. Despite a renovation to update the appearance they still can't get your order right. Almost half the time I go there they either give me the wrong item. Tonight I ordered two teas at the drive thru and when I got home it turned out they were both coffee despite being labeled as tea. Often this location is out of the item you want and take way too long to put your order together especially compared to many other Tim Horton's locations nearby. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else for whatever it was you wanted.	bad
A regular sized Tim Hortons.  Super friendly staff.  Unique selection of donuts that you wont always find at other locations.I love coming here.By the way if you're going to come here to meet with someone, make sure that you order something. They actually keep up on people sitting around and whether they are ordering stuff. This location keeps tabs on people because it certain times of the day there are a lot of young whippersnappers hanging out and not ordering.	good
Lovely vegetarian cafe that serves good big portions of wholesome meals. If you can't decide what to have at the counter, you can pick and mix, having 2 half portions of main courses for instance, or a main course and a couple of salads. There is a noticeboard, and often artists exhibit on the walls.	good
'Susie's' est un resto très informelle avec plein de nourriture végétariénne, bio, commerce équitable etc. Le déco est plutôt austère mais comme il est souvent rempli des gens l'endroit reste vivant et chaleureux. Très populaire avec les étudiants d'Edimbourg.	neutral
Susie's Diner is somewhere to go when you've indulged beyond the pale and your body is suffering physical guilt and demanding some healthy comfort. Generous portions of delicious vegetarian fare are the order of the day. They have a system where you can choose various configurations of salads, quiches and hot dishes for set prices in a canteen-esque set up. Prices are generally around £3-£7. The mix 'n' match crockery together with the self-service food and drink give Susie's a very informal feeling and the casual décor of red painted walls, unvarnished tables and wooden benches all contribute to the sense of being at the village refectory. Feel-good food in a family friendly diner devoid of any pretension. Lovely.	good
Located conveniently near george Square campus, this small albeit popular restaurant/cafe has a winning combination of great food, generous portions, good service and reasonable price ( also as a bonus, the 'guilt free' satisfaction of having eaten a vegetarian and organic meal). Desserts and cakes are to die for! The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is all smiles and you can linger over a meal and a conversation with a friend.	good
I was disappointed with Susie's diner. For 4.20pounds I got a small plate with one portion of hot food and some rice. No salad or anything. The service was also rude and abrupt; there is absolutely no excuse for rolling of the eyes and tutting when a customer doesn't have the correct change. I will say that the food was delicious (I made my small portion last as long as possible) but next time I would go to the mosque kitchen next door and get a much larger meal for less without the dramatic service.	bad
This place is where you will go when you are craving some home cooked food and cant get any! The food is standard home cooked meal types cooked very well. The servings are very generous which most will appreciate, although if some aren't too hungry it may be worth sharing.	good
I'm afraid to report that Susie's will be closing it's doors too soon. You'll be missed...	good
Susie's serves exclusively vegetarian food. The atmosphere and ordering procedure is a little too student to make the night of it more canteen than restaurant. However, the food is always great and there are plenty of pubs around for after.	good
You can find quick and tasty vegetarians options here.  I ate here several times while traveling alone in Edinburgh and felt very comfortable eating alone (not always the case at other places).	good
"I hope my 4 star rating isn't too generous. I had a few fantastic meals here followed up by two mediocre ones (all the same dishes). Service is also lacklustre at times but I really did enjoy the food when it was ""on"". I would suggest better consistency."	good
I'm really surprised about the crappy ratings this place has been given!!! Went tonight with my husband. Their homemade guacamole was amazing. I had the baked tortillas with goat cheese and shrimp, extremely tasty!  The service was friend, informative and really fast. The food was prepared quickly and well presented. Try the lime margaritas! We will be going back soon!	good
Courteous service but the food is terrible. I ordered the burrito which was cold and came with no noticeable cheese. Beef stuffing was dry and the only flavour I tasted was salt. Will not go again.	bad
Strong points:- Very tasty, simple food;- Reasonably priced, especially given the location;- Friendly, fast service.Weak points:- No vegetarian option for main dishes. Vegetarian entrées were available and I was told that the burrito's meat/chicken could be swapped for grilled vegetables at the same price. Weak. Also, grilled vegetables are not a proper vegetarian choice in 2015, especially in a restaurant that features beans and cheese in so many other dishes.- The booze situation. Every table outdoors is adorned with a centerpiece of three beers (not included, just to be clear). The first two pages of the food menu are actually a drink menu. When we were ready to order, with closed menus, our waitress reopened my menu to the drink pages and went on at great length about what was available. I understand that restaurants need to sell alcohol to increase the average check price, but the power sell was a bit too much for me and it really turned me off.Solid three stars.	neutral
Good service, horrible food! It came cold, and when i complained my food was cold (fridge cold) i was told its normal in a busy restaurant to cook all the food early in the morning and then reheat it for service. I respectfully declined that dish and paid for our appetizers and walked away.	bad
I realize how pretentious it is to review an airport Quiznos. However, this $9 salad I just gave up on is particularly bad. Most of the ingredients are literally frozen. The tomatoes also taste like rancid little iced cubes. Gross. Will not return.	bad
"I looked at the reviews and wasn't going to buy anything here. However, I saw someone eating a sandwhich and was hungry so I asked the person how was it? They had an Italian sandwhich and said it was good. I decided to go ahead and buy it because there weren't that many choices. This could have been great or at the very least good, but that was not the case. The sandwhich after having gone through the ""toaster"" was cold literally within 30 seconds. The taste was not great but not totally terrible either. There are only three places to eat and quiznos could easily be the spot to eat but it seems quality is lacking everywhere these days. If you can wait then I suggest you wait. However if you are really hungry maybe buy a snack or two it will probably cause about that much or even less."	bad
This was the worst/most expensive sandwich i ever had in my life.  I paid $9 for a steak sandwich that had no steak. One paper thin slice of meat on one half of the foot long sub was all i got and everything is supposedly prepared ahead of time so they wont/cant fix it.  And the actual bread was salty ...way too salty. and the sauce that came with it tastes like it was rancid.  The whole thing was inedible.  WORST ever. Dont waste your money.	bad
"It's Quiznos.  Yes, sticker shock, but it's the airport.  My 8"" Italian on Rosemary filled me up.  The crew working this location is not super fast, but the end product was consistent with my Quiznos expectations."	neutral
Average Turkish/Middle Eastern cuisine place for kebabs. The food prep time is atrocious (almost 30 mins) and the food isn't extraordinary. I wouldn't go back. Farhat is a better option which is also on CDN.	bad
"Average. I ordered the sandwich with lamb sandwich combo with salad and a soda.  The sandwich is blunt. The portion of salad is generous. I can't finish the sandwich so I tried to pick the meat out of the bread and I found a suspicious hair probably a eyelash. The worst part was that the owner wouldn't give us the receipt and charged five dollar more than what we should pay. I even asked did he include the tips in the bill. After he """"realized"" he charged more. He said he thought we order one more soda. What soda worth 5 dollars? That's totally a lie. He is not a honest man and he acted like it was our fault not telling him we took only two soda. I wouldn't go there again."	bad
Ehhhhh yani ! When you can't find authentic Turkish food it's like you have no choice but to go here hoping that you'll get lucky and eat something  decent, but unfortunately you can't eat anything good here . First they don't know how to make doner , bulgur pilav is sooooo dry have absolutely no taste ,let's talk about so called Adana kebab now that's a total joke it's just a minced meat filled with cheap quality red pepper to make it spicy and hoping that it becomes what is supposed to be but unfortunately it does not work that way , Now is the restaurant busy ? Ya kind of but with what kind of customers? Definitely majority of there customers don't have Turkish or let's say Armenian backgrounds , they cater to low budget middle eastern immigrants most of them from 3rd world country's where they don't have any idea what Turkish food is . People who reads our reviews will see that so far we don't have 1 good review about Turkish restaurants in Ontario and Quebec , that's because we travel to Istanbul 4 to 6 times a year and we really know what Turkish kebab is  unfortunately there is not one decent Turkish kebab restaurant specially in Quebec .Place looks like a old Middleastern mosque with all green walls , and the music that you hear while you eat? Omg in Turkish we say (AGIT) meaning? Sad crying song when someone dies this is the kind of music they listen at uncivilized Turkish villages. Before I forget Shepard salad , ezme are sitting on the counter( not in the fridge) yes on the counter covered with Saran Wrap so it does not get dirty , you have to eat warm Shepard salad that's unfortunate :))))) Is the place clean yes it is but then again that does not make the food good, Iam hoping 1 day In Montreal we will have a good Turkish kebab restaurants like Toronto or New York but I have no hopes ,why I don't have hopes?  Because who wants to invest in Montreal ? They rather go to Toronto Vancouver etc where they don't have to put up with tax or French bs. Thank you for reading my review	bad
Came all the way to NDG for some authentic Turkish kebobs. I had the mixed meat plate, which consisted of chicken, lamb and meatball kebab and some salads on the side. Let me just say, the portions are HUGE. One plate was plenty for two people. I couldn't even finish half of it and gave the rest to my boyfriend who was more than happy to devour it for himself. all in all, the kebabs are alright, not bad for turkish/middle eastern kebabs, but not quite worth coming all the way to NDG for either.   The price was reasonable, around $14 for the large plate, which can be shared generously among two people.	neutral
This place is nothing BUT express. Waited 20 minutes for two Chicken Kebab Sandwich for take out, and I was the only customer during dinner service.The sandwich was extremely bland, with barely any seasoning, or lack thereof.One more thing, the guy who was preparing my sandwich did not wash the lettuce I saw him chopped and he did not wash his hands after handling raw meat either.I won't go as far as recommending McDonald's instead of this place, but Subway is definitely a wiser choice.	bad
My friend was raving about this, saying it's as good as Antep (as if)I took the mixed plate, very little meat and was still hungry.Close to $20 with a can of coke.No rice, just some salad and a bulgur type of side.Bread was good, but meat felt re-heated.It's only ok if you've had your fill of Shish-Taouk in the city and are in the mood to try something else	bad
Turkish style Sandwich Restaurant. Went twice, the first and the last.If it wasn't for the amount of time you must wait until your friggin sandwich gets prepared (between 20-25 minutes!) this place may have a modicum of chance with the other dozen or so Middle Eastern sandwich places around the corner. And believe me it is not a busy restaurant. Although one can quip about their mediocre decor or lack thereof, I can only talk positive about the bread they use which is ok, not too fluffy and slightly crispy after it's grilled. Otherwise their other ingredients suck and the sandwich has no real flavour. Oh and they change their menu prices quite often and I once got charged the older higher price when it was time to pay. Not cool!  :((	bad
"Nice Decor, mediocre food. Do not go.This ""asian fusion"" is really terrible."	bad
"Dropped by for all you can eat (AYCE) lunch. For $12.99, it wasn't bad. Now for that price, don't order any raw fish dishes. It won't be 'jumped out of the water' fresh.The soups were good - a bit starchy but the hot and sour tasted fine. Thai mango salad - skip. The mango was nice but the sauce was awkward. Kind of like that teenager that hopes to be cool but can't figure out what style they are going for - grunge? Hipster? Goth? I would say ""traditional"" is best 4/5 times.I would highly recommend the teriaki chicken. I found their grilled dishes to be piping hot and crisp. I also enjoyed the inari and unami - not huge pieces but they were good...I'd go back. The service was quite attentive but you had better keep track of what you ordered. They often forgot your dishes or lost track of them. Hence why I can't comment on the dim sum, it never arrived!"	neutral
Actually, service is worst, you order something and they bring it partly and slow. While having all you can eat menu, even you order more they don't bring it to you and they have no explanation for it. It could get better in time but right now service is too careless.	bad
Lovely restaurant and lots of great options to choose from. The servers were great and the atmosphere was lovely. Drinks are reasonably priced, too.The sushi was okay- not top bar but not too bad. It was atleast good enough that I want to come back and try one if their main courses!It's always empty because people don't know yet what this place has to offer.	good
Great place! Lunch all you can eat for 12.99 with amazing options! Can't go wrong with the Malay rice and noodle dishes. Good service!	good
Updated: They've removed the all you can eat...not worth it now!For all you can eat this is very good! 11.99 for lunch and it's all you can eat sushi, thai, Chinese and some Dim Sum. For the sushi I would recommend the fiery dragon which is dragon roll with a nice sauce on top. Thai pad thai and hot and spicy chicken are nice too. The mango salad and the dim sum were only ok. It's not gourmet but for the price it's DEF worth it!	bad
12.99 for lunch AYCE. extra $1 for soft drinks with free refills (good deal)! The food wasn't bad, but the chicken wasn't fresh, there was a weird taste to it. Sushi rolls were surprising good. Service was bad though. Solo diners get ignored. That I can deal with since I have been to a lot of Asian restaurants in the past with no service. But this was worse because the manager was actually quite rude. And I got the impression that he is trying to control how much you order. I might stay away until service improves. TIP: SKIP the dim sum and go for the sushi instead.	neutral
Tried for the first time with a friend. This location has been under renovations or construction for a while, and it hasn't really picked up speed, so it's easy to pass it by.That and it's name doesn't seem that prominent, I thought Hot and Spicy was the description. Oh well.First impressions; it looks pretty fancy inside, kinda shiny, and the waiters and waitresses use littler ipad things to take your order. I almost felt like I didn't belong. But they were quite friendly, I guess they should be since it was only us and one or 2 people getting take out.My friend got the mango chicken, and I ordered a lunch special of grilled teriyaki salmon. The special was great, it came with a really good hot and sour soup, some dark organic rice and your typical kind of salad. The salmon was very good.The mango chicken was good but it wasn't a hit. And it costed about $5 more since it wasn't a special..I think overall the regular menu is a little pricey for me compared to other things nearby. I would come back for the special if I come back, since it was quite good and better value than what else was on the menu. And the service was a-ok. I think this place needs some more chances!	neutral
Just came back from the AYCE Lunch & gonna write & rate as I can still remember it:Miso Soup (3.5 Stars)Hot & Sour Soup (3 Stars)Thai Mango Salad (3 Stars - couldn't tell if the dressing had Fish Sauce in it)Satay Beef - WOULD NOT order again, too chewySatay Chicken (4.5 Stars - *REALLY GOOD!*)California Roll (3.5 Stars)Dynamite Roll (3.5 Stars)Spicy Salmon (4 Stars)House Fried Rice (3.5 Stars)Thai Basil Eggplant (3.5 Stars)Fried Tofu - WOULD NOT order this again.  Was under the impression this was cubes of tofu with the fried tofu skin, but it turned out to be tofu wrapped in won ton wrappers & deep friedHar Gow (3 Stars)Siu Mai (3 Stars)PROS:- We were able to get a seat when we arrived at 1:15 pm, but the place got pretty packed shortly after. - $1.00 Bottomless pop soooo good, not watered down at all.- The place is done up all fancy-like.  Nice atmosphere to sit in.- Service was quick & *SUPER* friendlyCONS:- No dessert on the AYCE menu.  - Dim sum items weren't that great - its like they needed more salt.  Kind of bland.NEUTRAL/OTHER OBSERVATIONS:- Didn't have the wonton soup when I ordered it, so I went for Hot & Sour instead.- The food here is kind of like Manchu Wok/Szechuan-Szechuan type food, with the addition of Sushi though  - Even though it says on the menu they will charge $2.00 for each item not consumed, they didn't charge us, even though we had about 3 half-dishes of uneaten items left.- If sitting by the windows facing Queen St., you don't wanna be facing west cause the sun will be shining in your face.  =S- I would go back for sure.  =)  The food could use some work though.	neutral
Stopped in here on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch with my fiancé. We ordered a soup and a noodle dish. The noodle dish arrived and was placed on my side of the table.  The soup never arrived. When we  asked about it the waiter said we only talked about the soup but didn't order it. Disappointment. Lesson learned repeat the order or ask the waiter to repeat the order. Went down the street to Ginger to finish the meal.	bad
I've been here once before and would have given them a 4/5, but today, the service was confused and slow.  The food was ok. There are better choices in the neighbourhood.They were slow taking my order, 10 minutes later another waiter brought me another menu.  They missed bringing out my appetizer. Kung Pow Chicken was ok and then it took some effort to get my bill.	bad
"Came here for dinner with my family and had a very poor experience. The restaurant was empty so we were excited to have dedicated service. Pros (although not many):1. Decor is modern and appears fairly clean. Cons:1. Very slow and incompetent service, despite being one of the only families at the restaurant. They kept getting our order wrong and bringing out duplicate dishes. An hour in to dinner we still did not receive our sushi and had to place our order again2. ""Cooked"" dim sum dishes coming to the table rawWould not come back and would not recommend."	bad
Been at this spot a few times so I wanted to give it a few takes prior to giving it a fair review.The food is very bland!  Any request for spicy food results in them tossing in chili flakes.  At Salad King they use fresh peppers!  When I was in Thailand, they use fresh peppers.  The peppers should be infused in the meal!!!Service?  I have only gone through take out, 3 times.  My last experience was super bad.  I had to go back and forth from my office to the restaurant since they messed up my order twice.  THREE trips to that location for 1 order is unacceptable.  The manager I met a few weeks back is super friendly!  I wish he was there to address that issue.Best of luck to this new restaurant!  Hope they do well in the end!	bad
No stars!!! Worst food and service I have received in a long long time. Got all you can eat. Our second round of order got lost somehow. Waited almost 30 mins for the food to come. Lost all the appetite. The manager was extremely rude. Never come back again!!!!That manager should be fired yesterday, if he even cared...	bad
Had the all you can eat and it really surprised at the variety of food offered. Salmon carpaccio is definitely worth trying as well as the thai basiil eggplant.don't expect service but they are friendly.	good
The food is great and I am ready to tackle the AYCE. Might go there today with my family if it's open for Xmas.p.s. my fav. dish is the sweet and sour fish. So good.	good
Dropped by for dinner before a movie at Scotiatheatre. Bad decision. Should have walked a few extra steps to the more well known and well rated places. This place felt like a tourist trap. Dinner is not all you can eat, but ala carte.Besides the green tea, nothing was ok. Hot and sour soup was commercial and average (probably better than anything else we ate). Chicken in black bean sauce was so bland and bad (even though we asked for spicy). Fried rice was meh. Sui mai and har gow were glutinous and barely had flavour. Very sorry to have spent any money here at all. Just looks clean and neat and spacious. That's all. Walk a few extra steps to Queen Mother or even Ginger. Or Trimurti Indian food across the road. Don't get trapped here.	bad
I remember Country Kitchen when I was a young boy living in Minnesota.  The restaurants were a lot fewer back then so going out to eat was a big deal.  My memories of it when being a child were all of people that I was with, and not the food, and now I think I know why...  If the food was as bland back then as it is now, it is completely forget-able.  I have dined at this Country Kitchen on several occaisions after movies at the UltraStar Theater (they should drop the Ultra...)  and I have brought my family here several times for breakfast or quick lunches etc.  It will do in a pinch, but I have yet to be really wowed and I am pretty sure I will not be.Country Kitchen is a lateral move from Dennys and IHOP, with a slightly better focus on service however given the area I know that service will be the first thing to go.  The area of the restaurant and indeed the area where I live is plagued by the economy.  We are a neighborhood of the haves and the have-nots.  When the have-nots barely speak english and disrepect the community it shows and it takes it's toll on the service people.  But I digress...back to the Country Kitchen.It is a bit pricey for what you get but there are lots of coupons out there including some from their own web site.  So if you must eat here, bring a coupon or the bill will somewhat infuriate you due to the wholly unexceptional food.  Without a coupon expect to pay 15-20% more than a Dennys or Village Inn for about the same food.On the bright side, I have had lunch here several times and really enjoyed the Reuben, so there is at least one sandwich that has some flavor and was not a dissapointment.  So there we have it, if you are dragged here to eat, get a Reuben.  : )Enjoy!	bad
We get takeout from CK every month or so, and it's pretty solid 'American' food.  The menu has a bit of variety, but you're not likely to find anything too wild or exciting on it.  At the same time, if you are looking for 'wild and exciting' at a place called Country Kitchen, you're probably going to be disappointed no matter what.I almost gave them 4 stars based on their seasonal breadbowl soups...try the pot roast soup, that was our favorite.	neutral
"Have been to Nick's many times for breakfast, but not because they have awesome food.  Nick's offered a ""buy one get one free"" coupon on the back of Fry's grocery store receipts so me and my girlfriend took advantage of that quite a few times until they stopped the promotion.The unfortunate thing about Nick's is the pictures of the food in the menu are great, what you get served looks nothing like it.  The food is average at best, me and my girlfriend joked that we wouldn't come back if it weren't for the BOGO deal they were offering.  They stopped offering it about 6 months ago and we haven't been back. The restaurant looks nice, it's clean.  The hostess and wait staff are all very friendly.  The food quality and chef expertise is lacking horribly."	bad
This manager is a chauvinist pig, he has fired me because he has gotten a complaint on himself, he has made sexual comments to almost everyone that works there and is a very rude person. I would not take any one that I care about to this restaurant!!!	bad
Southern hospitality? Yes ma'am (or Mister)  :)The first thing that struck me was that my server had a lovely accent. My daughter looked at me & asked me if it was part of her job to fake an accent,,,, I went with no. I'm not sure where it's from, but it's a 'honey & y'all' accent :D She had a very friendly disposition & made our lunch experience a pleasure. She made her mama proud. The food was decent AND you can have breakfast all day. I love having breakfast for dinner, so that's a big selling point to me :)The building is fairly new, not too brightly lit & clean. In all honesty I would have given them an A OK rating, 3 stars, but our server pushed them to a 'yay! I'm a fan', 4 star rating. Good people make the difference!	good
I've been eating at this CK since they opened ... I think back in 2008. I probably go once or twice a month for breakfast, and occasionally for lunch / dinner. I can say that their management in the past has SUCKED. They've changed managers several times, and can never seem to get a good one. I have no met the current one, I just noticed that the last one I met is no longer there.The waitresses are usually great. There have only been a couple that have been disappointing, and I haven't seen them around in quite a while.The breakfast food is pretty standard. Pancakes, waffles, omelets, and all the usual breakfast meats.Their burgers are decent, but I don't care for any of their other lunch items. Their all you can eat rib or fish & chips nights are a pretty good deal, but I'm not really impressed by their dinner food. However, I've never had anything that wasn't good enough for me to eat till I'm full.	good
Been here a couple of times and enjoyed it very much. I love their 550 calorie menu, chili is very good and they do have a wide selection on their menu? We will start coming by more often!	good
As the mom of  2 kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people don't give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carraba's). We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good. Not great, but pretty good and inexpensive. I will say though that their french fries are some of the best I've had! I would much rather come here than IHOP	good
"Despite Christine S and her stellar review, I'd have to say ""Surprise you can do better"" I've eaten country kitchen 3 times at time of this review, the food is nothing denny's IHOP or village inn don't offer, I'm a bit of a sucker for fish fry's so the one time we actually dined in, I had the fish fry and it's not bad, but nothing special. we've gotten their breakfast to go on a lazy weekend morning, the pancakes are decent, however my breakfast seemed to be kind of sparse on meat, the other night we got back from happy hour and appetizers with some coworkers of mine and we were still hungry, not feeling like fast food we call up country kitchen and order an order of their sliders and 2 milkshakes. they don't give us an eta or a total on the phone.so I wait about 10-15 minutes, leave my house which is about 2 mi away, arrive at the restaurant to find it completely barren at about 7:30PM, I approach the counter and the manager just continues to mess with his blackberry never looking up eventually, a hostess comes from the back and greets me, mind you it's already been 15 minutes and all they need to do was grill some small beef pattys and drop some fries, I still end up waiting another 10 minutes for my food, only to have everyone disappear into the back of the restaurant again to have another server come out confused and try to seat me. eventually I get the food, the sliders aren't bad, but there's only 3, WTF it's an unwritten rule that sliders come in even numbers, I don't know if it's just me, or working in a White Castle as a teen, but 3 sliders could potentially cause a rift in some relationships, the decor is an orgy of applebees, IHOP and denny's but imagine if you arrived  at the ""campy wall crap"" store only to find they'd already been cleaned out by an applebees corporate decorator, the decorations range from giant utensils, wireframe art, sports posters and scenic views.  I'm really not sure which direction they were trying to go.unfortunately Country Kitchen is the closest full service restaurant to my home so I will probably end up back here some lazy saturday morning picking up eggs and pancakes.I was excited to see Surprise Pointe being built and to see more services coming closer to me, so far I've only seen more of the same."	bad
This was a great place to stop and eat breakfast.  I enjoyed the fact that we were seated quickly and that they had the games on the TV.  It felt like I was at home eating breakfast.  Real cozy, which is something I don't feel at Denny's or Norm's.The menu had many options and they all looked good.  I was in the mood for something with cheese and eggs, but not an omelet, so I ordered the Skillet Scramble with a side of toast... it was freaken good!  Taste was great and the portion size was plenty (I did not finish it).I was out there in AZ hanging with friends for the weekend and glad we made a stop there for breakfast.	good
"Overpriced and boring.  There is nothing overly creative or unique about any of their menu offerings.  Very limited menu, especially for healthier or vegetarian options.  Don't be fooled by their claim to ""the best pancakes in town"".  They were doughy and not all that spectacular.  I would be surprised if this place was able to make it another 6 months, but according to their website, 5 new Country Kitchen franchises are due to open in the Phoenix area.  Good luck with that one!  Places like Denny's, Village Inn, and IHOP do a better job for less money and have brand recognition to boot."	bad
This place is OK.  Nothing really special or anything to get excited over.  Food quality and selection is at the Denny's quality.  Service was decent and food quality was decent.  Like I said, nothing to get overly excited about.	neutral
Most of the food is good, sometimes the fish portion sizes vary, once my husband ordered it and it was huge the next time is was like 3 times smaller. Service varies it just depends on who you get. Also the assistant night manager is rude. We took our 4 kids out to dinner since it was my daughters 10th birthday and was refused service since it was close to closing time. It was 7:56 pm and the sign on the window said they closed @9. Was told they channged the hours to close at 8 so we could not be served even though we were already in the restaurant ready to be seated.	neutral
Quite good for simple food. There's something to be said for not getting too fancy and that makes me a fan.	good
My wife and I have been to the Country Kitchen twice now and we have really enjoyed it. The servers we have had have been outstanding. Very attentive and friendly. On to the food. On my first visit I had the blue cheese burger with fries. the Burger was very juicy and tender topped with a good quality blue cheese. The fries were crispy and you could actually taste potato, not salt and grease. On our second trip my wife and I started with the loaded potato skins with a side of ranch. We didn't even have to ask for the ranch. The server brought it out because we had asked to have a side of it with our burger to dip there oh so yummy onion rings in. :) The potato skins had to be some of the best we have had. they were piled with there four cheese blend and crisp bacon. Fresh. and tasty. My wife and I split the big BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and it did not disappoint. The brought it out already cut and on two separate plates with an equal amount of onion rings on each. The burger was juicy and the BBQ sauce did not over power the beef. The service was stellar and the food was good. PS. you get 20% off with a movie ticket either before or after the show. So stop on in and enjoy great service and good food.	good
I think this is a great neighborhood place to grab a meal. We have come here 4 or 5 times for breakfast.  The service is always professional & friendly.Other people have compared this place to Denny's and in my opinion it's a much nicer dining experience. First of all it's open and not all cramped and it's CLEAN!The food is good, a nice variety on the menu. This establishment is a great addition to the neighborhood.	neutral
This place is great for breakfast and however many cups of coffee the help remember to fill. I think two is the limit.I overheard an argument between a customer and the manager about a brown steak. I think he watches too much CSI and should stop interrogating the customers. Have an alibi ready in case you run into any problems with your order.	bad
"I should have kept driving when we pulled in and there's paramedics with a huge Fire Engine in front of the restaurant with gobs of odd looking people standing around the commotion.  I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to.  But if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch....apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture but after being in the middle of two pretty intense verbal altercations that quickly turned violent, I knew this was going to be one of those experiences that I would write about on Yelp!  There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet.  I should have also noticed something was ""up"" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot.  But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal.  There were a lot of people shouting at each other and arguing, lots of mentally ill people glaring at us almost in an antagonistic manner.  Besides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap!  I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient."	bad
"We have been going here for years, I mean lots of years for the crab legs, mostly because they brought them out at  a reasonable pace which is to say not slowly.As of a few months ago if they felt someone was eating too many they started slowing down or deliberately bringing out ""skunky"" legs, the ones that taste real fishy and aren't really all that well cooked. On a recent visit the owner, a Chinese man in his late 40's or 50's actually yelled at a customer at length in Chinese  for eating too many crab legs. I have never seen such rudeness and we won't go back again, the food is a C-, the attitude is an F."	bad
If a restaurant wants to be reviewed on more than the quality of its bathroom, its food shouldn't keep the entire party imprisoned there.Despite wonderful service, a good price ($10 for dinner), a lot of premium dishes, and fresh sushi, the overall experience was awful. There weren't any standouts among the dishes- most everything was pretty generic. My whole table took turns rotating through the disgusting bathroom... somehow, we were able to time our vomiting. In retrospect, it's kinda impressive.I think the biggest problem was that the food was kept at room temperature. As others mentioned, the chef spent a lot of time checking on the dishes, but he didn't seem to notice that everything was tepid. The food also ruined the after-dinner movie, which effectively doubled the cost of our loss.	bad
I've been going here steadily for the last 10 years and it's by far the best chinese buffet in the valley. They've got tons of fresh sushi and any kind of food you want. The spicy chicken and sweet shrimp are my favorites. The place has been completely overhauled as of the last  months and it's never looked better. The owners are always on site, and if you want a specific kind of roll/sashimi/nigiri  they're very happy to accomodate you.	good
Yea I know most buffet's are ronchy, the food is actually pretty good here. They have fresh sushi, crab legs, and plenty of shrimp. The bathroom stinks, but the food is good.	neutral
I have been wanting to have Americanized Chinese for a week or so. After driving up 7th St. I stopped at this place. The place had faint wet-rag sort of smell to it, but it could have been that our booth seats were wiped with a wet rag right before as the seats were still glistening with water. The food is what it is and what you would expect, Nothing spectacular. They have the orange chicken, beef broccoli, spring rolls, and all those type of dishes, however not as assembly line and generic tasting as the Panda Express chains. One of the chicken dishes had chicken that tasted like the chicken was old or left out too long.  The bill for two of us dining including drinks(iced tea)was under $22.00 not including tip. Definitely cheap, however not worth more. The bottom line is if you are looking for a Americanized Chinese for cheap, then you have found the place.	bad
Had lunch here today with Rand H and Mike C and compared to other Chinese buffets it's just okay.  Nothing was really bad (except the Lo Mein noodles that tasted like they cooked in a burnt pan) and nothing really stood out as being really good.  I guess they recently did the flooring, and I found it to be very slippery, not good when you're carrying plates of food.They had a decent selection of the typical items found on similar buffets.  I did find most of the appetizer stuff, like crab rangoon and pot stickers were a little too greasy.  The fried and breaded shrimp was tasty and I did like their style of egg foo yung.  The staff barely spoke English and when Mike asked what something on his plate was, our waiter thought he was asking for more and brought them to him.  The service was attentive, but would have been better if they understood what we were asking for.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but if I was in the area and hungry and wanting a Chinese buffet, I'd definitely give them another chance.	neutral
"From the vending machines in the entryway selling gun and lowrider stickers, to the white plastic menu board hung partially askew, to the cheap-ass jewelry on sale laying out on top of the cash register desk, to the toothpick wrappers and various other little pieces of garbage on the floor in the foyer, to the fish pond with a single sad (possibly dead) koi, just about everything in the place screams ""We really don't give a crap"". That's the first impression.Why 2 stars, then? Why not one?Because the food was actually not . .. that . . . bad.Still, if you're after Chinese buffet, try the one at 15th Av and Bethany instead."	bad
"Captain's Log, Stardate 2009-09-17.  Stopped in this junction of the galaxy last night with three friends after spending all day moving my Captain's Quarters.  I was sporting my skimpy blue retro work-out shorts with white trim, as I was tired and wasn't in the mood to even change.  I garnered a few odd glances (such to be expected) but we were quickly seated.  I tend not to do buffets now, as I'm really trying to watch my weight, but this place was recommended to me by my Lieutenant.  I'll be beating him later, but I digress.  The food was pretty marginal overall.  It was definitely NOT hot enough.  Replicator food on the Enterprise is better than this.  Want to piss me off?  Serve me tepid food and then charge me $8 cubits a head for same.  Some items were better than others.  I almost think there were too many choices.  I'd like to see the choices narrowed, the temperature increased and the food quality improved.  As for eating sushi in a place like this?  No way in Hades.  Not last night, not today and certainly not tomorrow.  I'd rather chase Khan with a crippled ship in a nebula before I dine here again.Overall, C-There has to be better choices for buffet Chinese food in central Phoenix, and I'm on a mission to find it.  ""Engage long range scanners, Mr. Sulu.  We must find a suitable class-M Chinese food planet in this sector.""  :D--don"	bad
Yes, I realize I'm probably risking my health by coming here but I just can't help but like it anyway.It's cheap & there are lots of options food wise. They even have basic sushi rolls. That's a major plus in my book! Everyone seems to go for the crab, but I don't. If you want crab I suggest sitting where you can watch them put it out. Hustle your butt to grab choice pieces before everyone else.Keep in mind the people seating you barely speak English. There's always a language barrier. They're really only there to clear plates away.You shouldn't look around too much while there. The whole place is pretty divey but the food is good & replaced often enough. If decor is important to you don't come here. If you just want to chow down on all sorts of cheap food goodness then drop by. You'll leave stuffed & happy.	good
Went here for lunch with Rand H. and this place is big for a chinese buffet , it is in the shell of an old Sizzler. The food here is pretty good i do not think i tried anything that was not at least average with most dishes above average.they had a couple of different items as well ,mexican chicken wings that tasted like they were cooked with oranges and shrimp balls that were pretty good..So yes i would go back even though it is not one of my favorite chinese buffet but it is a good one.	good
OK - this is a Chinese buffet so I don't think 5 stars is even possible.Their quality can waver, probably as much by time spent on the steam tables as any other reason.Their fried shrimp, hot and sour soup are generally very good. Most everything is in the typical range. They always have poached salmon but the steam table is capable of making it uneditable but when not destroyed on the steam table, it's generally quite good.Friend said that their sushi was decent but I this doesn't strike me as a place to eat sushi.Evenings and weekends are priced higher but they generally have crab legs and beef ribs.Staff is generally friendly and attentive.	neutral
Went by this place last week and it is now closed down..Looked like they are preparing to raze the building.	bad
Cant believe its a 2.5 average.  I work around central and Indian School and this is THE Chinese buffet for everyone here.  Plenty of selection and its always good.  The servers are polite and its cheap.  Think its around 7 bucks.  They recently renovated and its much nicer inside.  I have been there a ton of times and never been unsatisfied.  If someone has a Chinese buffet that beats it out on price and quality in this area please do tell!	good
"I shan't be returning.Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought ""why not Chinese?""  I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.Being greeted on the way in with a ""You are on camera"" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.But then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the ""orange chicken"" from the ""sesame chicken"" from the ""pepper chicken"" by any sense other than sight.The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.I won't be back, unless I'm told they're under new management."	bad
Spot check on this place = now closed. I live in the area and cruise by once a week. When it was open it was ok at best.	bad
Good food, though I didn't find any of the dishes outstanding, and there were not as many offerings as I would have expected for a super buffet. The variety of dishes was pretty much what you would expect for an above-average Chinese buffet. The staff was very friendly, the restaurant spacious, and the meal was inexpensive and satisfying - a good meal at a good price.	neutral
I would give this a 3 1/2.  Typical bar food selection but the food is not so bad.  I just don't love that the menu is literally one page. The atmosphere is great though. A tv at each booth!???!! Awesome for avid sports fans. They have a huge selection of beers, wines and hard liquor so this is a great place to hang out. I prefer happy hour with three dollar drafts and six dollar margaritas :) service is a bit slow here and it was a bit hard to get our drinks refilled but the atmosphere can't be beat. This is a good place to hang out and eat, just not the biggest of menus. Also, there are coupons a lot of time in the clipper magazine!!! Check it out.	neutral
It was hit or miss for us. We got burgers and first off, the bread. They looked like the 8 pack burger buns you get for an outdoor cookout. They looked and tasted cheap. I got the A1 Mushroom burger and it was pretty good, except I ordered medium well and it was pretty well done even tasted a bit of a char (not a good thing, IMO). My wife got a burger that was flavorless.The service was great. The beer was great. Decor of the place was great. It was just the food that left a little to be desired.It was cool to have a TV at the table, probably a great place to watch the game with the guys.	neutral
"My girlfriend and I showed up at 7:30 on a Friday night and it was completely awful from the moment we entered. Walked in, hostess rushed us in to a huge booth within the bar with open door. Why not ask if we were there for dinner, drinks? Both? Ask a preference of seating. The open air area was a complete hot box, very humid to the point that people were sticking to the booths. Hostess then left, didn't leave menus, beer lists, nothing! Server arrived and could tell we were annoyed, we informed her that it was our first time there, we were just rushed in, and wanted to switch to the other side. She told us to, ""Just go tell the hostess"". We did, she again just rushed us over to the booth as if there was something wrong with sitting at the bar itself. We then sat in a different booth for a full 15 minutes without a single employee coming over to us! I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant until that moment. We went in to Oakmont to spend our money ($160 on the evening) I guess Brewstone didn't care for me to spend my money there. While the décor was great, coming from the service industry while in high school and college they lost me for good. I would never even go back to try the food."	bad
Absolutely terrible! Just got up and left...seated for 15 minutes and no one came to even take a drink order!	bad
I had heard some bad reviews about Brewstone, especially about the service there. So I was not expecting a great time when I walked in on Wednesday night but I was pleasantly suprised. First off, I have to get this off of my chest...I was a huge fan of John Harvard's. I was a member of their Mug Club from the moment they started it, and I miss it horribly. So naturally I was very disappointed that the brewing equipment is gone. Don't let the name fool you, Brewstone Beerhouse is not a brew pub. However they do have a fairly good list of craft beer available, as well as the regular cra*.  The service was very good. Our waiter, Lindley (?) was very nice and attentive, extremely helpful as was the bartender in the back bar. The food was good, I had a burger (cooked perfectly, very tasty) It was a little loud, there was a live musician playing by the patio area, but in the back by the restrooms the place was much quieter. The personal TV's in the booths will make for good Football and Hockey seasons. I enjoyed my visit and Brewstone is definitely somewhere I will be visiting again.	good
Nice design and sporty atmosphere surround you in this large detailed restaurant. Food is decent. Ordered mac and cheese but got more of a penne Alfredo instead. It wasn't bad but not quite what I ordered. Oh...and I'm clear the server was high...Good for sports and beer I'd imagine.	neutral
"I got the feeling that Brewstone isn't exactly sure what it wants its identity to be.  There are a large number of beers, but as far as I know, none are brewed by Brewstone.  There is a large bar and huge seating area that seemed like sports bar meets high class lounge.  Booths each had their own individual TVs (along with several TVs on the walls) but there are also fireplaces and other items that didn't seem to go with the individual TVs.The menu is equally as mixed.  There are traditional bar favorites, but then there were some ""fancy"" things as well.The nacho appetizer is HUGE.  The two of us could have eaten it and not had an entree and still been full.  It was tasty, but they should consider cutting the portion and the price.  Or at least having a half order option.The corn chowder is amazing.  I loved the taste and texture and was disappointed when it was gone.The burger, sliders and pasta were all OK, but nothing remarkable.We'll probably be back to try other dishes and possibly happy hour specials (half priced martinis), but we won't be rushing back."	neutral
"This place is in transition from ""Brewstone Beer Co."" to the ""Breakway Bar and Grill"" and is under new management. Restaurant: L shaped setup. Two bars full bars, one indoor and one indoor/outdoor. The indoor bar is in between the main entrance and the dining room. The indoor/outdoor is to the left of the entrance away from the rest of the restaurant. The indoor/outdoor bar has booths with personal TV's, an ""O"" shaped bar with plenty of big screen TV's, and roll up doors which are open on nice nights leading to the outdoor patio. The place is very nice and clean. Very nice look and upkeepDrink: Great beer selection. They have a long list of beer on tap which includes your normal domestics, seasonal beers, and micro brews. Most places do not have this selection which is amazing for people who enjoy this type of selection. PLUS, they have a two full bars for people who love liquor. Food: Food has changed since the name has changed and the business is under new management. The menu is similar but not quiet the same and they have rid the menu of many of the items that I liked. They have a good variety consisting of steak, chicken, sea food, burgers, and homemade pizzas. Overall the food is decent but not as good as it used to be. Atmosphere: Great overall. Dining room and inside bar are a good casual family area. The Indoor/Outdoor bar is separate and has more of a casual bar feel to it. Great place for any occasion and for sports games. Staff: Overall they are not bad but they are certainly not great either. Some of the waiters/waitresses are good and some not so much. All of them are friendly however some seem very new while others are veterans in the food service. The service is very inconsistent. More consistency would go a long way. Overall: Good but not great. I miss the Indoor/Outdoor bar being open more often. It really gave the place a different dimension and a more causal relaxing feel that nowhere else really offers during nice days. I also miss the homemade dressings, specialty pizzas, BBQ sauce, and custom burgers. Sure they offer these things but they are not the same as before. I like the place and will go there occasionally but not as much as before. Would have 4-5 stars if they would go back to some of the things that originally made this place the way it was."	neutral
The Brewstone was perfect for a casual dinner and drinks. We went on a Saturday night and there was no wait, our booth was comfy and had a tv along the wall. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a flight of three different beers. They had a large selection of beer to choose from and the food menu was great. The prices were good and the food we got was very good.	good
Brewstone has lost their liquor license due to being habitually delinquent in playing alcoholic drink tax to the Allegheny County treasurer's office. They have been permanently closed for months.	bad
Back a second time. Not good let me tell ya.  This time a burger. I expected better, way better. This burger was ordered medium and came out burned and hard and bad as a cinder block. If you know what that is. Why would they send that out to someone to eat. Disgrace in the back. Who is in charge back there.Onion soup was so-so. Blah.Called the manager and told him, they need to do something in the kitchen, because I would really hope they could be better. Why, well the environment here is outstanding, a great venue, and the beer is good enough.	bad
My wife and I dined here on a Wednesday night (2/5/14), and at first, we were very upset and told each other that we would never come back again.  We asked to speak to a Manager, and the manager Carrie was extremely friendly, customer service oriented, and helped make our visit a much better experience.  We will be back thanks to Carrie fixing the issues with our meal.Long story short, we waited 35 minutes for our appetizer which was just cheese sticks, and then waited over an hour and 15 minutes for our dinner.  My wife ordered a burger which ended up coming out like a brick it was so overcooked.  I ordered the boneless wings with mild sauce and the wings were overcooked, and cold when I got them.  It looked like they were actually put in the microwave by the way the sauce was by the time I got them.  After waiting an hour and 15 minutes, we were not happy at all.   The manager (Carrie) came over and apologized to us for the quality of the food, and for the wait time, and assured us she would take care of it.    Within 10 minutes, we had a replacement of our wings and burger, and this time they were cooked perfectly.  Carrie also compensated us the check for the wait time and the food being messed up the first time around.  Turns out that there were 2 parties of over 30 people booked at the same exact time and the kitchen ran behind.	bad
I had a great experience at Brewstone.  I miss John Harvards and am really glad they put a similar restaurant in that space.The server was great and very knowledgeable about the beers.  She recommended a terrific wheat beer that I very much enjoyed.  The portions were huge and you really get what you pay for.  The food is also very good.I just bought a gift certificate for Brewstone to have an excuse to go back.	good
Perhaps most the opening week jitters have been corrected. We stopped in last night for dinner and were very impressed.  As mentioned in another review, the place is spotless. They invested some serious cash in converting the decor from what used to be a dimly lit John Harvards location.   Two bars seems odd however but both were relatively busy. I went with the fish and chips as it's my baseline for what any bar/pub should get right without worry. It was a bit light on fish and heavy on fries but both were good, so I can't really complain for the price. Better half had the BBQ pork sliders (carolina style) and thoroughly enjoyed them. Mixed drink for her and draft micro for me seemed reasonably priced. Draft beer list was certainly bigger than I expected from earlier reviews. Having a TV inside every booth seemed excessive, but should go over extremely well with the sports crowd and should do wonders for BW3's prices and awful service across the street.  At least none of them had volume on. Wait staff seemed very attentive but this may also be because they just opened and over-compensate. A roof over the patio seems necessary, we'll never sit outside on a sunny day without it and nobody was out there either on our visit. We'll definitely be returning again to try the rest of the menu and catch the drink specials during a steeler game. Glad to see something different than just another chain restaurant move in the empty spot in Penn Center.	good
Bartender overwhelmed with no one in the place.  He seemed like he was up for a few days on amphetamines.  I walked in at 9PM, Could get no service till 9:08. Immediately informed kitchen closes at 10PM???  What is up with Manureville... no places open late...and this is directly across from motel with everyone on business trips Duh!  The stupid shall be punished, looks like this place will be closing... I wonder if owners know bartender is inept and chasing people away at 9:00...probably not.	bad
Since I work long hours, many times the criteria for a restaurant is how late it's open.  Sometimes, you get both (open and good).  Brewstone was both!.  We have driven past this place a zillion times and never gave it a second thought.  Last night, we needed a late night place so we stopped in.  First of all, it is GIGANTIC.  There are several dining rooms. We were seated in one of the bars areas.  Honestly, if you like sports this is your place.  There were about 40 televisions just in this one space (this includes a personal TV at each table.  We ordered some late night snacks.  My fiance ordered their fish and chips special.  He loved it.  It was crisp and very fresh.  Wasn't as enthusiastic about the fries. But all in all, he was happy.  I ordered wings.  I did half Teriyaki and half Buffalo.  Maybe it was the time of day I was eating them, but the Buffalo wings were crazy hot (spicy).  I preferred the teriyaki ones better.  They were all fresh and juicy.    The service was good.  We will probably return.  Maybe for some March Madness?	good
"Brewstone is BEAUTIFUL.  Twinkly patio lights, huge, Sonoma-esque vibe inside...seriously, just gorgeous.  Unfortunately, that's the only thing it has going for it.We arrived and promptly checked out the huge specials board on entry.  It was Wednesday, so patio pint night.  $3.50 craft drafts?! Sign me up.  We were seated, next to a screaming baby might I add, inside, even though we requested the patio.  We asked our server to be moved to the patio.We moved to the patio, where our new server tells us the special: half off lettuce wraps, which was advertised on the board as the next day's special.  For Ladies' Night.  Whatever.  We order beers anyway and hope for the best.  We order nachos that have no meat ingredients listed in the menu (unless you opt in), and they come smothered in beef chili.  NOT cool for vegetarians.  Especially when most of the entrees here are approaching the $20 range, I don't want to be surprised with ""secret ingredients.""While eating, we overhear two parties next to us request to speak to the manager.  Not a good sign.  Bill takes 45 minutes to arrive after requested.  Beers aren't on special.  We pay full price and high-tail it out of there.  Not going back!"	bad
This place is under new management. It is no longer called the Brewstone. The food was so so and there was nothing super spectacular about it. I had a wedge salad which was OK except for the fact that the bleu cheese dressing was not bleu cheese dressing. I had mussels for dinner. They were extremely over-cooked. Everyone else had a burger and they all came out wrong or missing an ingredient.  The beer selection was decent and current.The wait staff was great which counters for the ignorant hostesses.  The two girls were not welcoming.  They sous there and looked at us and didn't acknowledge us or the other people who came in at the same time.  They stood begins the counter which is in an odd place as you didn't know it was a host stand.	neutral
This is a tough place to review...The decor... 4.5 stars.  Lots of seating options indoors and out.  Tons of TV's available for game day viewing.The menu... 3 stars.  It's got the usual sports bar fare, but because the place looks so nice, I expected a more extensive menu that just a one page, black and white printed list of their offering.  Perhaps we got a game-time/lunch menu??The food... 4 stars.  Among the 6 of us, we ordered 2 kids of wings (Garlic Parm & the Whiskey Bourbon), but for $10 you'd think you get more than 8 wings per serving.  Both flavors tasted pretty good; though I would have liked a little more garlic or salt on the garlic parm flavor.  We also got the nachos - pretty standard, and a variety of burgers.  Everyone enjoyed the burgers.  Very flavorful and moist.  The drinks from the bar were pretty sweet.The service... 1 star.  Sure, it was game-time, opening weekend of the NFL season, but the place wasn't packed.  Most of the patrons were seated in either of the two bar areas.  I only saw one table in the large dining room.  So, either the placed wasn't properly staffed by management for a game-time crowd, or the service was incredible slow.  Our server was very nice and courteous even when I'm sure she could tell we were getting annoyed with repeating requests for refills on drinks long empty, or asking about the status of our food, but she kept a smile and responded politely.  The pricepoint ... 3 stars.  The prices were about what you'd expect for bar food.  $10 for a burger, etc.In all, while the food was pretty good and the set-up/layout of the place is nice, I think the only way I'd return is if I was truly there just to watch the game, and the drinks/snacks were an afterthought.  If I was going to hangout with friends and watch the game and wasn't going because I was hungry, then it might have been okay.	bad
Food Hounds... every so often while on the road, we come across a place that is so incredible that it raises our standards in coolness and flavor.  Brewstone Beer Company was one of those dynamite experiences that just put smiles on our faces.  An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale; but offers an array of mind-blowing food!  Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect!  Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing... never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of... well - Nachos.  Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili... should I go on?  We opted for all three meats: grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving.  It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish.  LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan.  As for the steak... sweet and unbelievable!  Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date.The Seared Ahi Tuna again blew my mind... Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds; the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic!  I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine; lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang.  Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella; but aside from the obvious... they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying!  So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure.  Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne, then topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken).  The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds.The entrees cometh... we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich; the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect. The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow... big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter!  Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie; the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic.  I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic!  Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions... full of cheese with a killer flavor.  Beautiful, bountiful... absurdly GREAT!  Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner; but with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy!  The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and then drowned in heavenly gravy.  Everything was incredible from the food to the service and the environment itself; this is certainly not a place to be missed.  We'll be sure to pop in next time we're in town - especially for those nachos... Hmm... if I leave now...	good
"This place looks amazing! The beer choices seem really good. The food is really not worth the price.Our server never mentioned anything special though we said we were new too the place. We asked what was great and she said, ""Well, pizza is really good, but our pizza chef isn't in yet. Everything else is decent."" (1pm on a Sunday). Not a good sign at all. We should have known by how empty the place was. So, I ordered a burger, medium, that had goat cheese and bacon (server told me not to get the goat cheese because it can be ""overpowering""--another bad sign since goat cheese is quite mild, but I asked for it anyways). Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger.Wife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side. Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated. It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing. The dressing was unbelievably strong in vinegar flavor. So strong that my wife asked to take the tuna and have them just provide new greens. One fork dip in the dressing was strong enough. $16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine.Beer was good, but she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle. Food wasn't good. Service was, meh. In an empty restaurant, you expect servers to be accessible.We always go twice in case it was just a fluke, but judging by other reviews, this may be a drinks-only kind of place."	bad
New ownership, new menu.  Best meal we've had there.  Excellent mozzarella sticks.  Fresh tasty Cobb salad.  Tasty burger with bacon.  Nice meal, great service, reasonable prices.  Much improved.	good
as with everyone else, the decor is very nice and very inviting.   Other than that, well, it ends there.    The beer selection is good, but no one knows anything about beer there and the waitress tried to pretend like she knew.  Waitress was rude, messed up our order, took 25 min (empty restaurant). The burgers we ordered were burnt, we ordered medium, and the soup tasted frozen out of a bag.   After we received our check, the waitress disappeared, not asking us for additional drinks etc.... We chose to walk up to the bar and order additional beers,   the bartender was mute at best.   Upon leaving, we said goodbye to both hostesses, but they were too busy texting and talking to each other and we didnt even get a thank you, have a good night, whatever.     Management NEEDS to take a deep look at how they train people.  One person, we could understand, but the whole staff was uneducated.  Its a shame, cause this place could have soo much potential and we want it to succeed.   thousands of dollars on decor and frozen food does not make a restaurant.	bad
"My husband and I tossed around ideas of where to go for dinner on a Saturday night (3/08/14) with another couple. Our friends suggested ""Breakaway Bar & Grill"" or Brewstone, or whatever name they are going by. Our friends arrived before us and put our name in for the waiting list. The short women with longer black hair took the reservation and had a HORRIBLE attitude. She called our name and we gathered our belongs in hopes that we were going to be seated, she said, ""No. you aren't being seated. Just want to asks you a question."" Well. Ok? We finally got seated after a few minutes of confusion because obviously she had no clue what she was doing. We sat at a large high top table and waited 10 minutes before our server finally arrived to take our drink orders. Then another 5-7 before finally taking our food order. The food menu was lackluster, generic & over priced.I ordered a burger to be cooked ""medium"" with a side of sweet potato fries and my husband ordered a pizza. When our food arrived my burger was cooked well-done, flavorless & the sweet potato fries were room temperature at best. My husband stated that his pizza was sub-par at best and was clearly frozen pizza crust instead of freshly made. Throughout the course of visit random people (I'm assuming who were management but was hard to tell from their very causal jeans and tshirt) came by to take empty plates instead of asking about our food. Our waitress was scarce so we were often left with empty glasses. Needless to say, we won't be returning due to poor attitudes & over-priced below average food."	bad
brewstone has one problem that holds them back. Their service is absolutely terrible. their food is delicious, great beer selection. but when it takes 45 minutes to get appetizers or 15 minutes for a draft beer its unacceptable. I have went here three times at different times of the week and have expierenced the same problem.	bad
"Because we had such a terrible experience last time, I posted a complaint on their official site and we were invited back for a ""comped"" dinner.  It was a million times better than our first experience.  Our waitress had some experience and you could tell.  She was knowledgable about the food and alcohol.  The food was fresh and tasty (but I would not say this is a food destination for me), and the regional manager stopped at our table to offer an apology for the last time we were in. With that being said, I know we will be back to this place because it is a great place to hang out with friends and family, and I appreciated their attempt to win back a customer who was very disappointed."	good
Had dinner here with friends.  The place was not very crowded but the food and service was terrible.  I had a chicken dish that was so salty i simply could not eat it. Our server never returned to fill our drinks or ask us how the meal was.  I can not recommend this place.	bad
Was a cool place.  The food was alright and they have a decent selection of beer.  The place is huge and has a big outside.  The only drawback with the outside is the only view you have is a sweeping expanse of parking lot.  I ordered coleslaw with my dinner and it looks to be homemade!  There were big pieces of cabage all through instead of shredded cabage like you normally see.	neutral
Really bad service. Did the same thing that some others did. Tried it last week food was ok and service was bad. Tried again service was really slow, really bad. Bartender has no clue what to do when you place an empty drink closer and closer  to the the edge of the bar. Hopefully some one from there will read this and let him in on a clue you fill the drink after you walk past it at least three times. . The best part is lets you a glass to get ice out of the ice bin.  The bartender pretty much talked to one group of guys on the other side of the bar and ignored the rest of the bar. Have no clue who the bartender was but we were in Sunday night after 11:30pm on the 29th. I'm in the industry and reall didn't feal bad about giving this guy a big zero dollar tip.	bad
"I went here for a happy hour/light dinner and sat in the bar.  The booth was extremely comfortable and i love the TVs at the table.  Others have had issues with both the food and/or the service.  Luckily, everything was good for my group.  Our server was both friendly and efficient - she did explain that the restaurant is undergoing a transition to a new brand, ""Breakaway Grill"" and therefore the menu was a little different and the beer list wasn't up-to-date.  I asked for an IPA and she was able to rattle off a handful that they DID have on draft.  Food came out quickly and the potachos were decent but could have used a bit more cheese.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken Flatbread - and it was good.  I would go back here.  Granted it wasn't extremely busy so I can't speak to how the service would have been if they had been busier."	good
I like brewstone. I live in Monroeville, and it is one of the few places that isn't a chain. The place is big, and it attracts a wide variety of people. This isn't my first choice of place to go on a Friday or a Saturday night, but it's an alternative if I don't want to drive to shadyside. Their food is good. I like the margarita pizza the best. They have a decent number of brews. I'm not crazy about their live entertainment.	good
The atmosphere is warm and modern. The bathrooms are beautiful. The nachos are heaping. The draft beer selection is vast.The service is terrible. I went here on a bike night. Usually bike nights are informal sit where you want but this place was different. The hostess had to go and see if there were tables available. This took her a few minutes and she informed us she would have to move a table. Which she did not need to do. She did not know the specials. Then the waitress came over and told us we took some one else's table. No one sat at the table the whole time we were there. We moved closer to the fire. Then the waitress took our order, not when she originally talked to us but a few minutes later. She barely knew the specials. We ordered our drinks. The waitress brought them in a reasonable time only to spill one in front of me and the other on my leg. No big deal, but it did happen. I asked about the food specials posted, and she said they did not have any. I asked a manager as well. The cards on the table said food specials. He said there were none. Then the waitress brought the check. Our beers were full price. She told me it was the beer tax. They were $4 per beer and had two different prices after this beer tax. She fixed it after this was pointed out to her. On the way out the manager did not even ask about the evening. He did not get my opinion and will not be getting my money again.I gave it 2 stars versus 1 because I did not try the food. If the food is bad then this place is a 1 star.The service is poor. I will not be back.	bad
Good atmosphere. Good decor. Great beer selection. $5 craft beer pints, typical on what you would pay for those. Waiter was knowledgable about the beer. Food was ok. We had a salad and pulled pork and it wasn't anything amazing for the price.  TVs at every booth was really cool and plenty more around to view every game	neutral
LOST THEIR LIQUOR LICENSE!Went for dinner last night and were surprised to see it almost empty. Hostess explained that they had lost their liquor license s couple of weeks ago! We stayed anyway and found the food to be quite good but service was slow. We also noticed that they didn't inform some guests of the liquor issue until they were seated, which I found to be somewhat disingenuous.	neutral
"Saw this place when driving in Monroeville and stopped in, turned out it was opening week so I hope it gets better.  For a place called Brewstone, I was expecting a place that brewed their own beer.  not only do they not, but  they had one of the worst beer selections I've ever seen at a bar, although their online menu listed dozens of beers as ""coming soon""   Our waitress was unfamiliar with the beer selection they did have as well. The food was not very good either, I had chipotle chicken sliders and they were bland with no hint of chipotle and the chicken was tough to the point I felt like I needed a kinfe to cut it.    The best thing I have to say about this place is that it was very clean, but it's only been open for a week."	bad
"We were very excited to have a new restaurant open in the former John Harvard's space, as it's very close to our house and we go out to eat often. The Brewstone interior is beautiful, with lots of wood, and a gorgeous stone double-sided fireplace. It's without a doubt a warm, welcoming environment (although I could do without so many TVs everywhere). I really wanted to love Brewstone. We first tried it for dinner on Sept. 19. Service was slow to the point that the manager came out to apologize. Our server was very pleasant and apologetic, and we were forgiving as it's a new place. Some of the food was good (I liked the fish tacos) and other dishes were average. We tried Brewstone again last night, 9/24. Service was again very slow. I can understand that the kitchen gets backed up, but I don't expect waiting 15 minutes for drinks to arrive. And when my beer arrived... there was a gnat floating in it. I didn't want to wait for our waiter to return, so I walked the beer over to the bar. The bartender replaced it with a ""sorry"" without any sincerity. We tried the quesadilla and pizza and both were average at best. The fries are not so great either. So... I'd give Brewstone 5 stars for ambience/decor, and perhaps 1 1/2 stars for food and service. I sure hope that it improves, I really want to like it."	bad
Decent draft selection and local brews including full pint church brew works all saints rivertowne and east end.  Excellent staff and really good burgers.  Fun sports bar atmosphere with a touch of class.  Too bad it is under new ownership.  Hopefully the new owners don't change much.  We have been here many times and always leave happy.	good
"To be fair, it has been several months since I visited Brewstone, so things may have changed since then (hopefully for the better).I am not writ ting this just to be critical; I am hoping the management will read this and make some much needed changes.Since the place is a Sports bar, I am going to go with that ""format""...Strike one:  Brewstone is not a brewpub, which is what I was expecting.  The ""beer experience"" is severely lacking as the ""beer menu"" was very confusing.  Instead of telling you what beer is what, the menu and the wait staff give you a vague, general idea of what beer you are going to get, such as a ""citrusy, hoppy beer,"" (which equates to an IPA) or a ""dark, sweet beer,"" (a stout).  Being a minor beer snob, I found the process bewildering as I had to guess at what I was going to get.  They should just tell you it's a ""Stone IPA,"" or ""Founder's Breakfast Stout,"" instead of letting you ""guess.""Strike two:  The service was less than stellar.  Again, this may have improved, but after we ordered our drinks,  the waitress said she couldn't find the bartender, so there was a delay.  Our waitress (a very young woman) seemed to really be trying, but it seemed like she wasn't trained very well.  Strike three:  The food, again wasn't great.  I got a burger and it was so-so.  My wife was mad that she didn't even get a piece of bread with her salad.  Our 2 friends weren't impressed either.  I spoke to someone else who ate there and they really liked the food, so maybe it was what we ordered..... dunno.Overall, we were disappointed and underwhelmed.... and we really wanted to like the place.... there aren't too many places in Monroeville that I really like.  I hope the management reads these reviews and makes so much needed improvements."	bad
The atmosphere was great, good decorations, and a TV on every table let us view an unobstructed Pens game. The food was average. The fish and chips had an average batter, but the the large pieces of cod were cooked perfectly. The fries were good as well. The waiters all seemed nice and energetic.	good
The place just opened last week, and I came on Wed night. The interior is enormous with two separate bar areas, a large dining room separated into two spaces by a dividing wall, and an outdoor patio space. The place is full of flat screen hdtv's, and will be a magnet for football fans on weekends in the fall. They have a major high-end sound system throughout the place (which was sadly playing 70's/80's pop music accompanied by videos on some of the tv's). The a/v investment is very impressive.I have no doubt this place will be popular. The menu is full of reasonably priced classic sports bar fare like wings, nachos, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, etc. I stayed safe and went with bbq chicken wings for app and a cheeseburger for dinner. Both were good. Pints of craft beer were $3.50 on the night I came, but not sure if that was an opening week special or the normal price.I have a couple of things to call out:1) For a place called Brewstone, and with craft beers all the rage, the draft beer selection is weak. I counted 20 different draft beers, most of which are available anywhere you go (Bud Lite, Sam Adams, etc.) I expected a wider selection of craft brews on tap.2) I would expect a place that has made such an enormous investment in audio / video equipment would likewise invest in sports programming. I'm sure they'll have the NFL Ticket package, but come on guys, throw us a bone and get the MLB package for the summer. On this night, the Pirates had played during the day and so virtually every tv was showing ESPN programming. I can stay home a see that.Don't come for the culinary experience. This place is about sports on tv, and music when no sports are on.	neutral
What a wonderful place! We ate dinner here for the 1st time a few nights ago(and it happened to be bike night). The place is very clean and the décor is beautifully done with a lot of woodwork and stone...very inviting, comfortable, and pleasing to the eye.The beer selection is why I came, and it did not disappoint! Excellent! A large and varied selection that is sure to please us discriminating beer drinkers out there.As for the food...I sampled the 4 different meals that were ordered for my table and it was all excellent, well prepared, and presented well. I personally had the fish tacos, which were phenomenal! The menu was just right, as well--good selection but not so much as to overwhelming you.The service: well, let me say this: I came for the beer. But I will return because of the service. I was amazed at the level of expertise and service our waitress exhibited, along with her genuine concern for our happiness and enjoyment. She was spot on with everything. THIS is the kind of service I live for! Our server's name was Kerri(sp?), and I give her and Brewstone my highest recommendation. Well done!	good
Went there for breakfast with car club, about 15 people, Service was friendly and lots of standard breakfast fare, all hot and fresh. Variety of eggs, sausages, French Toast, pancakes, fresh fruit and coffee/fruit juices. Just show up hungry and you'll enjoy the place.	good
I generally love Swiss Chalet! The chicken, ribs and gravy are an quick and easy dinner solution. The service at this location was not very good. I ordered a half chicken dinner and the chicken was very, very dry. It was like they had kept it on a car engine or somewhere else that was warm  and uninviting overnight somewhere so that it could be served the next day. The experience has me turned off from eating any Swiss Chalet for a long while. In hindsight, I think I would have been better off getting breast meat and warm sides from the supermarket across the street.	bad
This Swiss Chalet location is only for take-out and delivery which works great for me. I tend to stick with the chicken soup, which is amazingly hearty but once you order 3 (because for 2 ppl that like it a lot, 1 ain't enough) it comes to nearly the same price as two regular meals ($15!) so that sucks. That isn't this location's fault, though. It's good and quick and convenient, so it's worth it when you don't want to stop by a busy restaurant.	neutral
I wanted Swiss Chalet and knew that there was one on the corner of Spadina / Bloor. Little did I know that when I walked in - it was mainly a take-out delivery spot with 3 high top chairs for quick eating. Didn't matter, I was getting take out anyway.I'm not lying when I tell you I LOVE SWISS CHALET. It is my go-to comfort food and it is always consistent every time. It's been quite some time since I last ate it but I had no doubt that it would not disappoint. Sadly - my expectations were a whee bit high.. both on the food and the service.There was no one at the counter when I walked in and waited several minutes before anyone showed up. I was watching the cook in the back as he continued to prepare his next order leaving for delivery. The girl was super nice and efficient but I had gotten a little impatient. The store smelled of major BO which made me want to leave as quickly as possible and the space was run down and dirty.When I finally got home and hoped to enjoy the awesome quarter chicken dinner, I found that the white meat was rather dry, than the usual juiciness, even if it was white meat. The corn (side dish) was also dry, and over cooked - pretty sure it was microwaved. Surprisingly, the chalet sauce seemed rather salty (maybe it's just my tastebuds), but overall... a sub par dinner that I had high hopes for.Maybe it's time to stick with dine in and dark meat........and ribs next time :)	bad
I have to say, I agree with Cher on this one.  I really liked this place.  The food was very tasty, and the staff was very friendly.  I moved from the area shortly after finding it, but I would probably stop back by if I was in the area again.	good
I have a confession to make my fellow yelpers...I am SO sorry to say this, but I've been hiding a lil gem all to myself. China Buffet is my all-time favorite chinese food buffet. We're always greeted with a smile and a nice autmosphere, I like the sing-songy contempo chinese pop in the background, it's not too loud so it's good. The dining area is vast and is always kept clean. The uniformed staff are always on the ball - clearing plates as soon as you take your last bite and always offer to refil drinks.The food is very very good. I love the bbq pork. The sesame chicken & beef n broccoli are favorites of mine as well. Their wonton soup is super yummy! I always start every meal a nice bowl of a couple of 'tons. lol. But the real attraction for me is the Sushi Bar!! Their sushi is real hit or miss... but is more hit than miss... and since it comes with the meal - it's worth atleast taking a gander at. Their salmon nigiri is always good when in stock, as is their shrimp nigir - but I have had a couple of pieces of bad tuna nigiri, which disappoints me but I still go back and give it a go. When tipped well - the sushi chef will make things to order. The sushi isn't the best in the city - by far, but it is good. I've taken a lot of people to China Buffet and everyone liked it except for one friend who thought their abolone was gross... but abolone IS gross... regardless of where it comes from. And so i say unto you, my fellow yelpers please forgive me for keeping this place a secret. I hope you try China Buffet and enjoy your visit. It's one of my favorite places to dine anywhere and I constantly use this place a measuring rod for the new chinese places I visit and they rarely compare.	good
This place has good food and friendly service but hardly any business. I was there on a weekday at 7 pm and I was the only person there. Not sure if that's do to panda express being  next door.	neutral
I love the banh mi here. Banh Mi can be very difficult to find but here it is Very authentic and cheap. Good quality and flavor. Along with that I always order the Vietnamese iced coffee which is a delight. They make it fresh. It's good food for a great price.	good
I'm going to give this a 5-star for their Avocado Shake! I love, love, LOVE their avocado shake. It's best made when the owner (father looking man) makes them. His kids (well at least I think it's his kids) help out and make the shakes too, but it  just doesn't compare to how he makes them. I'm not into trying the other shakes because they're not made with real fruits...they use powder mixes...except for the avocados.	good
Terrible boba drinks. Everything uses powder mixes. Even Tea! I have had many boba drink from garden grove,CA to Chandler,AZ. This place isn't even close to their flavors. By the way, I ordered the Thai iced tea, it tasted like water with POWDER Thai tea mix and some milk. It tasted just that: water and powder.	bad
I've gotten boba drinks here before, but today was my first day getting a sandwich.  I spent last weekend chowing down on bánh mì in Cali (a shop on every corner) but I hadn't gotten my fix. This did the job :) I got a chicken sandwich and it's stuffed full of veggies! Yummmm. The chicken isn't too bad either.	good
I always get friendly customer service here. And they have a lot of real fruit drinks here. I think they are one of the best places for boba drinks.	good
Groceries and sippin on some boba is the life :))Ive been coming here forever.  I love the owner. I use to cut his hair til I move to a different salon. Hehe :)My best drink ever is the ice thai tea boba!!!!!! DeeelishhhhhhhhGreat sammiches as well. :)	good
One of the best bolba in town. I hope they dont close, lee lees seems to be in a bad situation right now but i hope if they close this place gets a new venue.	good
"We got problems at ""Our house."" Tactless and  Nickle & Dime you...leaves me bothered and brokeI must admit, I am a little excited to write this review. I had to wait and let myself cool down.My sister just came back from Cali and while there tried boba tea. I was shocked she has never tried...nevertheless we were on the search for boba tea.Being from Portland, OR and loving FatStraw on Hawthorn for its boba tea I had somewhat predisposed standards of the the root based little novelty . Little did I know Our House was not operating on the same level...I had the Strawberry..Both of my little sisters had Taro..We all had boba in themSister 1 did not like the little boba and wanted to exchanged it for a different drink. My lil sister...barely 11 walked up to the counter and politely asked only to get rejected, she walked back sad, knowing she either dump the drink or power through the drink. I then walked up to the employee and discussed a few business ethics and standards that AZ and USA operate at a normal basis.  With his broken english he refused any refund or exchange transaction....I thought to myself...all this for what... for his poorly made product? Pick and choose your battles.Sister 2 did not lik the AZ based boba tea store...she wished she was still in Cali. Don't we all.Me: It cost me just under $4.25 for one drink w/ boba, tack on an additional $.50cents for the fact that I used a debt card!..So i payed 4.75ish for a drink made with powder and NO customer service.."	bad
We were at Lee Lee's market and decided to get boba drinks. I ordered passionfruit to try something different. The flavor was very artificial and the drink was very watery. I went back to get a different drink and the girl at the counter tried to charge me for another drink. I asked why they would not just replace the drink with a different flavor and she responded with a smirk that it was my fault because I ordered it. That is extremely poor customer service. I am bummed about this experience, because we have always gone to this place for boba and had never experienced this kind of treatment before. I think the girl was the owner's daughter. As I was being refused, the owner walked behind her, grinned, did not do a thing. Businesses do not succeed with this type of behavior.	bad
I've come here a few times and must of the time it's just a bite under a 3 star. I'm not into the powder mixed drinks. I feel that the drinks come out too sweet and watery. If I had to base this on the Avocado drink...oh man...I'd add more stars. The avocado drink is from fresh fruit and I was very pleased to see that. It's my favorite flavor thus far and it's probably cuz it's not a powder mix...plus it really does taste like avocado. It's not too sweet...it retains it's true flavor. I'm definitely coming back for this drink...no doubt!	bad
Waited at the counter for a few good minutes before I was finally acknowledged, (the man was pacing back and forth so I'm positive he knew I was there. Anyway, decided to stop by just because I was already inside grocery shopping. Ordered the avocado boba and again, waited and waited. The whole ordeal was about 20 minutes. Finally got my drink and definitely tasted like some cheap a** artificial stuff. You could tell that they didn't use real avocado. What a waste of money. I feel bad for the people trying boba for the first time at this joint. Please try bomboba! It's in the same plaza by subway.	bad
This is the other restaurant in Lee Lee. I don't know if it's Korean, Vietnamese, or what. They have sushi, banh mi, boba tea, and a cooler case full of kim-chee. It's more of a casual, grab and go type establishment than Hope Kee.I can't say anything about the quality of their food. But I did grab a thai iced boba tea. YES - two awesome things combined in one drink! Not only that, it was really good. The lady who made it was so proud of the quality of their boba teas, she insisted that I take a sip before I even left her counter. Then I sucked down the rest before I even got to the end of the block. It was so worth the belly ache.	neutral
This time was not that good. Took forever. Sandwich was very bland not as tasty as I remembered. Maybe different cook :(	bad
I have been in several times. Three times for sushi and three times for the vietnamese sandwiches. I see some lower rating. I rate on service, quality of food, value, how do they make me feel. I have always been treated very well. I am by no way an expert on sushi or vietnamese sandwiches, boba drinks. This is the only place I have ever had a baba drink. All I know is I have always  gotten good service and the food was good. Their boba drinks or the ones I have tired are very drinkable. I don't usually get one because I find them too sweet. If I eat chocolate I like a 99% bar. They have limited seating I think about 4 tables with three chairs at each table. They are set up for the people that are on the go. Order a sandwich, sushi, drink eat it there  or take it with you. The sandwiches are inexpensive, less expensive than eating at one of the fast food places. I have been there about six times now and will be going back.	neutral
Super experience , note they now serve alcohol !!  Love the decor and friendly vibe .  Had a super nice guy take my order and recommend great stuff , I ate a pesto bowl and a sandwich with tumeric bread.   Both great.  Also super cheap drinks .  Vanilla Smoothie to finish me off which alcohol was added to as well at my request.  Prices great and food better than some more famous vegan restaurants in the city I've tried .  Highly recommend as a vegan  !! :)	good
So much deliciousness...luckily we have time! Vegan places are popping up big time in Montreal, and Propulsion is one not to miss! The sandwiches are out of this world! My favourite is the purple taro sandwich and I chose to have the fig bread, the homemade vegan mayo is incredible and their rice bowls are delicious too!The ambience is relaxed, the staff is very friendly, they are licensed and I'm told that they make food until pretty late at night, so double win for vegan midnight snacks!I look forward to coming back to check out the smoothies, the chili and well pretty much everything!	good
Being a vegan tourist is not easy, as you probably know,  so I was really happy to find this place.  And it was excellent!  The staff were incredibly helpful and sweet.  The food was delicious and fresh.  The iced tea was amazing.  A wonderful compliment to poutine for lunch!  I had the fennel sauce and my partner had the mole. Both were incredibly savoury and the vegetables were perfect.  Each flavor was so distinct and complimented the others nicely.   The zucchini cake with avocado icing was a delicious dessert.  I only wish I could eat here all the time!	good
Amazing little vegetarian restaurant with delicious, simple food and a really inviting concept. My wife enjoyed the fennel/pumpkin bowl while I indulged in the mole bowl. We split a vanilla smoothie, and ended the meal with the most delicious sweet potato cake topped with maple frosting, and sliced kiwi and mango. To top it off, the owners both front and centre and really really nice guys. We will definitely be back!	good
At this airplane-themed vegan resto you have a choice of either bowls, sandwiches or salads (seasonal, but who really craves a cold salad in -30 weather anyhoo...). My dining companion and I went for bowls - she chose the brown rice with Mexican Mole sauce, marinated tempeh and asparagus/beets. Mine was a quinoa with pumpkin-fennel-cashew purée and grilled zucchini and steamed cauliflower. Both had nice little mache, sprouts and a drizzle of balsamic - a beautiful and well-rounded dish. My only critique would be that the purée wasn't hot (or even warm) and neither were the veggies and the quinoa was only slightly warm. Consistent temperature (either hot or cold) would have been preferable as it was an odd mix. I'll just be sure to request that next time as regardless everything was delicious and clean-the-plate worthy. The service was very warm and the selection of drinks both alcoholic and non was nice - kombucha, tisanes, coffees, smoothies etc. No room for desert but they had coconut-banana and coconut-mango ice and other sundries that were tempting. Halfway through our meal we had a lovely surprise where one of the staff started playing the piano...instrumental music - mostly covers ranging from Daft Punk to Bjork to the Mamas and the Papas. A nice touch. Will most definitely return.	good
Every once in awhile I have a meal at a restaurant that exceeds all my expectations, and it happened recently in of all places, Montreal, Canada.  In a city known for smoked meat and french fries loaded with gravy and cheese I had one of the best meals ever at Propulsion Cantine Vegetalienne. A Vegan restaurant  with an Airplane theme on the famed Saint Catherine's Street.  From the menu to the decor, from the waitress to the owner, this place is funky, fresh and entirely unexpected. Simone and I brought some friends with us who were Vegan and we actually arrived about twenty minutes before closing. I was a little nervous that the service and the food would be sub par because of the time of night but we were happily greeted on arrival by the quirky and funky waitress whose name I cant remember but whose personality I can never forget. She was more then willing to talk our ears off about the entire menu and about their new restaurant that has only been open since mid summer 2013.  The decor is aviation themed including a mannequin of a 1950's pilot and many parts of an actual propeller plane that had crashed and the owner had bought and turned into the bar and some seating tables.  It is all very cool to look at while waiting for the food.  Speaking of food, we decided after speaking with the waitress that we would just let her decide what to eat and so she started us off with a sample of a cool and refreshing cucumber smoothie. From there the four of us split a create your own bowl.  This was a imaginative concept where you choose a combination of grains, vegetables, and sauces. We went with a Pesto Bowl and had Quinoa, Bean Based Pesto, and fresh grilled Zucchini and roasted Cauliflower in it. Although completely dairy free, and thickened with garbanzo beans, this was the best Pesto I have had. It was creamy, nutty and garlicky great. The quinoa and vegetables were cooked perfectly as well and this was a great start to the meal.  Next we wanted to explore the sandwich menu (all sandwiches come with tempeh in them and of course your choice of fresh, moist, light vegan breads) .They all sounded so good our waitress suggested we split a variety of them and she would be sure the kitchen would cut them into portions for us. I didn't think it would get much better after the Pesto but these sandwiches were just over the top great.  The choices we went with were the Lentil Cari sandwich ( my personal favorite), The Mungo Mango ( voted by my friends to be the best), and The Purple Taro Portabello (still good but third on the voting scale). The Lentil Sandwich on Turmeric Bread was tempeh with a lentil patty that had a hint of curry and spice and just the right amount of smokiness, The patty held together on the outside and when you bit in the lentils were cooked perfectly tender but not mushy.  I have never had lentils that tasted so good in my culinary life and the only thing that upset me about this sandwich was that I had to share it with the rest of the table. It was my absolute favorite. Next up was the Mungo Mango. This was also pretty good and consisted of Chinese Mung Beans and Fresh Mango's  with tempeh on Fig Bread...It was earthy and sweet and everyone at the table loved it also. Lastly was the Purple Taro Portabello.  It was also good (and very purple) with mashed taro and sauteed mushrooms with tempeh but I found it to be a little soggy and less flavorful then the other sandwiches.  By the time we ate all the food it was past closing but when we asked the waitress if she wanted to cash us out to help with closing she told us not to worry about it and then she went and ate her own dinner.  We ended up staying for awhile longer and chatting amongst ourselves and with her and it was only when the kitchen (and pilot outfitted owner) had started to leave that we got our check. On the way out we took some vegan cookies with us for the road and they of course were great.  That night I dreamed of Lentil Sandwiches and so the next night Simone and I went back for another helping of sandwiches, pesto and good conversation with our friendly waitress. There was also a great piano player that second night who was amazing and we ended up staying again until closing. Everything about Propulsion is five stars, in the future they will be adding Vegan alcoholic drinks and fresh local salads. I hope that people check this place out because it truly is a hidden gem and I hope that I will have the pleasure of many return visits when I travel to Montreal.	good
Very accommodating staff. Ate there late on a Saturday night and they ran out to get supplies for drinks we ordered. Some of the best service we had while visiting Montreal. The drinks were very good and as there were few parties in the restaurant the bartender made us  some drinks on the house. Overall, a memorable meal that was very reasonably priced.	good
After a week of being in Montreal and not eating vegan my husband and I were thrilled to discover this place while walking on St. Catherine St. in the Village, a block away from the Beaudry Metro stop.  We had the rice and mole with broccoli and a smoothie.  So happy to have something healthy.  Met the owner and his mother who were delightful.  It just opened a month ago and I hope it is a success.	good
After eating at several amazing vegan restaurants in Montreal we didn't think there was anymore room to be impressed but our lunch at Propulsion was amazing!! We started with a vanilla smoothie and enjoyed every drop! It was very refreshing! My husband ordered the mole maple with brown rice and veg and loved it. I had the pumpkin on barley found it to be very satisfying and tasty. I'm glad I added the extra tempeh. The smokey flavour really worked with the rest of the dish. We finished off our meal by sharing a piece of sweet potato cake topped with maple sauce and fresh fruit. It was mind blowingly delicious! These guys haven't been open for long but have created something great! I do hope they do well so we have a chance to go back on our next visit.	good
This small sandwich shop is well located and food is O.K. The sandwich that I had was fine. Nothing memorable, but decent. Many items were not ready when I went there for lunch. Hopefully next time when I visit I would have the chance to try more items from the menu.	neutral
Went there for a late night lite meal.Great meal, entertaining staff who were exceptionally friendly. Fresh ingredients, good smoothies. Delicious pesto! Perfect for light vegetarian fare.	good
I was very happy with the place food was great it s a vegetalian restaurant. There is entertainment evey friday and saturday night with a pianist playing as background. They also different kind of activities for customer s to enjoy. So bottom line, I recommend this place	good
Cantine oui dans le sens où c est vraiment convivial on est bien accueillie et non pas pour une grosse bouffe grasse calorique etc.La décoration dans le style aviateurs des années 60 est vraiment cool et donne tout son charme à cette place. Le bar est une aile d'avion (c est vraiment cool) et ils ont un vieux congélateur et un vieux frigo des années 60.Pour l ouverture nous avons eu droit à un musicien qui jouais du piano et ce sera la cas tout les vendredi et samedi soir et avec un thème différent a chaque fois d'après ce que le musicien disait. On a aussi eu droit à un spectacle de danse de salon, toute ces petites choses font qu on se sent bien dans ce restaurant.La serveuse était très dynamique et à l'écoute des clients et malgré que le restaurant était plein son service était très rapide.Le propriétaire de la place qui est aussi le chef a vraiment réussi à accomplir une chose formidable (le restaurant). Il passait à l avant et on pouvait lui parler un peu même si il était dans le rush. Puis j ai adoré sa tenue style mécano : salopette, chemise, vieille casquette et goggles.Pour manger j ai pris la salade de roquette à la vinaigrette au framboise accompagné de vegepate. C était vraiment bon. Il n y en avait ni trop ni pas assez. Juste suffisamment pour avoir de la place pour le bon gâteau au patate douce.La carte affiche des prix vraiment abordables.J espère que ce petit restaurant va réussir à se faire une bonne clientèle.

La déco vaut vraiment le détour ! Même si dans l'assiette et le service, la présentation fait un peu plus cheap : on est assurément dans une cantine.On regrette simplement que les savoureux sandwiches ne permettent pas d'apprécier davantage les produits (mungo mango par exemple).Pour les desserts, le gâteau avec glaçage à l'érable est un régal !Le prix modéré et la terrasse bien placée sur la rue Ste-Catherine en font néanmoins une très bonne adresse pour les végétaliens et autres omnivores moins fortunés, de passage à Montréal, sans en attendre autant que La Panthère Verte (3 adresses en ville...) ou Crudessence (...mais c'est une autre histoire !).	neutral
"Qu'on ne se laisse pas avoir par le mot ""Cantine"", ici on est bien loin des patates frites grasses et des hot dogs relish moutarde salade de chou. Le concept est intéressant; On propose un menu interactif (et extrêmement abordable, les prix n'allant pas plus haut que 15$ pour un plat) où l'on peut créer à l'aide d'une liste d'ingrédients originaux son sandwich, sa salade, son bol-santé et même son dessert! Et qu'on ne s'imagine pas un comptoir à la Subway; tout est préparé à partir d'aliments frais et bio dans la cuisine pour ensuite vous être livré dans un bol genre ""petit cul-de-poule"" ou ""gamelle à chien"", dépendamment de vos références de vie. Ça fait pas de très belles présentations, mais ça fait parti du thème j'imagine. Un clin d'oeil au chutney de poivre rouge, j'en aurais acheté un pot à ramener chez moi si j'avais pu. Mais Propulsion, c'est plus que de la nourriture, le gars avait une idée encore plus poussée derrière tout ça. Voulant donner un aspect théâtral au souper de ses clients, on peut donc jouir de la présence d'un pianiste qui se donne en spectacle les vendredis et samedi durant toute l'heure du souper. Ça, en plus du décors style rétro sous le thème de l'aviation (Le bar est en fait une réplique d'aile d'avion!), ça vient créer une ambiance vraiment agréable et qui sors de l'ordinaire. Par contre, je cherche encore le rapport avec la nourriture végétalienne et les avions... Et soulignons la serveuse qui fut d'une rapidité exemplaire, je veux dire, pour un souper d'ouverture et un restaurant à presque pleine capacité, j'ai vraiment été impressionnée par son travail. En tant que nouveau restaurant végétalien (ça pousse cette année à Montréal non?), ils ont réussi à se démarquer grace à leur concept original. Est-ce que ça va être assez pour les faire survivre à la forte compétition qui commence à s'établir dans le milieu? Je leur souhaite! Mais ce qui est sur c'est qu'ils valent le détour, autant pour un lunch on the go, un souper entre amis ou un healthy craving à 4h du matin! (Un resto végétalien ouvert jusqu'à 5am les vendredis et samedis? Yé!)"	good
On a trip to Montreal, most people will recommend that you check out the city's culinary scene in some way, shape or form. That's no simple task when you're a nut-allergic vegan dating someone who's gluten free and lactose intolerant.So the fact that this place was a five minute walk from our hostel off Ste-Catherine was a godsend. Do not be alarmed by the pilot-dressed manikin in the window (which is kinda creepy) or the questionable stability of the upcycled plane wings as tables (which are still extremely rad). The food and service at this place were really exemplary.I can't remember the last time I felt so physically healthy and still deeply satisfied after leaving a restaurant. The miso plate I got was excellent and the complimentary smoothies that we received the first time around were so good that we went back to have them as meal on their own before our return journey to the states. The owner was really friendly and he even switched out my complimentary smoothie for another after he learned about my nut allergy. Food was delicious and I stress that even if you don't have a restricted diet, if you just want to feel good and energized after a meal while still enjoying a culinary experience, this place is worth checking out.	good
"I was taken here last year for my birthday and wasn't quite sure what to expect.Let me be really clear about this, I'm not only vegetarian, but I'm an extremely picky eater--so when I looked at the menu and my eyes started to glaze over in that ""Oh no, What the hell is any of this?"" manner I was somewhat crestfallen (it was my birthday after-all.)2-3 minutes later, and a quick discussion with our server, my meal was on the way. They were extremely happy to customize just about any aspect of my meal to make me happy, and the food that came out was delicious.Then there's the price--so affordable, I'd really expect to pay a lot more for the size of portions and quality of food you get here, it's definitely a great place as far as money spent/value goes.The only negative for us were the tables. Ours was a re-purposed airplane wing which, while cool sounding, really sucked as tables go. I'd make sure you specifically refuse those tables if you're offered one.Lastly there was the piano player. I'm not sure if he's staff, a local, a regular, but he was *amazeballs*. I'd go back just for drinks and to listen to him play if there was some sort of regularly scheduled announcement :)"	good
Such a relaxing, calm place with delicious, healthy food. The people who work there are friendly, too. You don't need to be a vegan or vegetarian to enjoy it. I loved the quinoa bowls and also the mango mung bean sandwich. I went here a few times during my vacation in Montreal because it's one of the few healthy options in this area.	good
"Non-descript pub with non-descript bar food. Decor and smell are ""sticky"". Waiter very pleasant. Expensive for what you get."	bad
Used to love Local 4 for the relaxed mood and good beer, but the last time my wife went she saw a mouse.  Vermin is a deal breaker, obviously.  We'll never go back, and I recommend avoiding under all circumstances (unless you're an exterminator looking for work).	bad
I'm not a drinker but that didn't distract from the good time I had here.  Great atmosphere and very comfortable.  It was a perfect place to sit around and chill out with friends.  Might also be a great place for games night as they had a huge selection of board games at the door.The staff we very attentive and friendly.  The playlist on the bar tenders ipod also made the night a good one.  I'd definitely go back for a night of drinks and fun with pals.	good
I used to work in this area and would have LOVED to hang at this place, but only visited for the first time last night post-Elite event.The staff was so friendly and accommodating and we were a large group! Local 4 just had a nice, relaxed vibe, 10 good taps (including Pear Cider YUM!) and the few bites of food I tried (thanks Christine and Dennis) were very tasty.I would definitely go back. I bet the front patio gets crowded in the summer, but I'll chance it.	good
We went here after the Elite event at chino locos (which was good). We were the first to arrive and the staff was excited to accommodate us, worked to find a good place for us to hang out, including moving some people around. They had a great selection of beers, including what I was drinking which was Okanagan Pale Ale. Throughout the evening the service was great. I had some shared nibbly food, and that was very good also.  I'd definitely go back here. Not the normal neighbourhood I'd go to for a drink, but I'd consider it now that I've been here.	good
Great atmosphere, but the food took forever to arrive. My falafel was really heavy on the pickled onions which distracted from the flavor of the rest of the dish.The service was great, and it was a really nice spot to hang out in, but i was really disappointed by the food. My dining partners really really loved their meals, though.	bad
Everything at Local 4 was good, but not great! The burger was good and I had a Blanche de Chambly which is a good beer, at a good price, served by a good server... you get the point. Nothing really stood out!I would be happy to go back, but wouldn't out of my way to do so.	neutral
Went here today (Friday evening) to use a coupon my friend bought on www.groupon.com. Needless to say we got a really good deal :)Place was pretty nice. Food good, service GREAT and nice decor. Overall I would say it's nothing that will blow your mind but it's still better than average! They have a nice patio out front too.We tried the butternut squash cakes for an appetizer, and split 2 mains - a sundried tomato with pesto pizza and the Local 4 falafel.The falafel was delish, the butternut squash cakes too. Pizza was mediocre. Note that the food is slightly more expensive than posted on the online menu - they need to get that updated but it seems to be about 10% higher now.Our server was absolutely great, made food recommendations and was attentive and funny too.I'd go back for drinks for sure, wouldn't go out of my way to return for the food, but if you happen to be there - the food is good.	good
This is another good place to drink in Toronto. It's just off Yonge Street. Everyone that we met here (both employees & customers) were really nice. Drink service is good and fast. I have not tried the food - but I definitely will the next time I go and update my review then. This place has a very relaxed atmosphere.	good
cozy place right off of Yonge street. Not enough staff but sufficed for when I was there. Great steak and their Long Islands were probably one of the best I've ever had. I'll be going back again for sure	neutral
"Let's be clear: this place is horrible.I'll cut to the chase, because its unforgivable. We ordered a couple apps and a couple cocktails. As I was eating a sweet potato won-ton, I bit into a large chunk of dirty plastic that had obviously come from piece of machinery used to prepare these over-fried pieces of tasteless, greasy cardboard (on a side note, it was served with some sort of ""spicy Thai"" sauce, which is really a scoop from some giant vat of mass produced combination of soy sauce, fake ginger, and MSG). When I told the server with a shocked face, he seemed so indifferent and complacent that it was almost some sort of a normal occurrence to him. ""Oh, okay,"" as he took the plate away without any question. I asked for the bill immediately, and when he returned with it later, he told me he had removed the offending item so that we wouldn't be charged.Listen... I just chomped down on a piece of machinery and it hurt. Don't think you're being some generous prince by knocking the thing off the bill. I gave him less money than the total -- basically enough to cover the drinks -- and told him that's all he was getting. Again, no reaction.Here's where I tell you that the menu sucks; the crab cakes taste like they came from MM Meatshop; the stale olives in the martini tasted like aluminium. The only saving grace was the readily available boxes of Trivial Pursuit cards, which quickly lost their novelty.This is what concerns me most: we came here because people on Yelp said it was decent. Trust us, and just walk a few doors down to Volo instead. They're pricks, but at least they have great beer."	bad
