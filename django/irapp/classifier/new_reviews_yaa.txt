The minute you walk in you realize that this isn't some honky tonk dive, this is a very dark, classy place, with a large bar and plenty of seating&&&&ambience+food
This is the type of place that you would normally find in NYC, LA or Nashville, so its a great addition to Scottsdale&&&&food
In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if this becomes the place where national musicians go to play a few unannounced sets when they are in town&&&&ambience
Great place to come to have awesome drinks with your friends and listen to some country music&&&&ambience+food
Cool decorations and fun atmosphere&&&&ambience
The bar top is awesome so check it out&&&&ambience
They also have awesome customer service&&&&ambience+food+service
The bar tender Dave is an awesome guy and really knows his stuff&&&&ambience+food
He always has a great attitude and a smile on his face which makes for a great visit&&&&food
Keep up the awesome work Dave&&&&ambience
Come check out the Western for a fun time with great people---5&&&&food
Bartenders were were not very helpful, did not provide quick service, and left a lot to be desired&&&&ambience+food+service
We paid a $10 cover for a band that was okay,&&&&cost
The liquor selection was good, with top shelf whiskeys, ryes, and vodkas, an adequate scotch selection, and fairly good beer selection&&&&ambience
the cover was unacceptable and more than anything else the service was crap&&&&ambience+food+service
Save your money and go and support bartenders somewhere else&&&&ambience+food
Saw a band play and had delicious food&&&&food
Pulled pork sliders with pineapple slaw, onion rings, fries, and drinks are TASTY&&&&food
Great atmosphere and music&&&&ambience+food
I am so happy they brought back the guitar player during Friday Happy Hours&&&&ambience
The food is awesome and the bartenders are very friendly and attentive&&&&ambience+food+service
I go there once to twice a week,&&&&food
Pretty unique spot in Old Town&&&&ambience
Live country music and dancing&&&&ambience
The band was good, sound was good, vibe was good--until I walked up to the bar&&&&ambience
I appeared to be interrupting something when I walked up&&&&food
asked the female bartender how much the well drinks were and she said $5 as if she was already annoyed with me&&&&ambience+food
asked her what a buckshot was (since that was the $1 special on the board&&&&ambience+food
) She didn't have a straight answer and instead asked the male bartender, "it's uh whatever we feel like making, we'll start with whiskey?" I ordered it, what the hell, YOLO&&&&ambience+food+service
Big mistake--the "buckshot" tasted like cough medicine and corn syrup&&&&ambience+food
Before my order was complete the male and female bartender are snickering with each other as if they are sharing their own private joke&&&&ambience+food+service
that shouldn't really matter&&&&ambience
The crowd was there drinking (and tipping) these two because of the band&&&&food
Why the attitude? Before the band's set was over the male bartender starts cleaning up the venue, pushing chairs in (loudly) and collecting glasses from tables&&&&ambience+food
The male bartender and female bartender appeared to be flirting with one another in the back corner, laughing at customers, etc&&&&ambience+food
I definitely wasn't the only one that was feeling uncomfortable&&&&ambience
These two bartenders were not only chasing the crowd away&&&&ambience+food
The venue itself had a cool vibe (aside from the nu-metal blaring in between sets), the prices were slightly more than average ($5 for a draft beer, $5 for a well drink, $1 for a "buckshot") and the service, well the service was non-existence&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Word of advice if you are the duo reading this--if your income is highly dependent upon tips, you should probably be nicer to the 20 or so people that are actually in your bar on a Monday night instead of driving them (and the band they came to see) away&&&&ambience+food
I haven't eaten here&&&&food
only came for a Friday night out on two separate occasions&&&&cost
Great live music and reasonable priced drinks&&&&ambience+cost+food
the laid back, fun-loving scene with tasty beer, grub and music is totally my style&&&&ambience+food
The live music is great and people are totally down to boogie&&&&ambience+food
The food is definitely southwestern comfort food&&&&ambience+food
Not a whole lot in the way of meatless fare,&&&&cost+food
I've only eaten here once&&&&food
The deep fried grilled cheese was, well&&&&food
Love me some shoestring fries and I could probably just have those for a whole meal&&&&food
The jalapeno mac n cheese was surprisingly spicy in a good way&&&&food
This spot is totally becoming a regular weekend hangout&&&&ambience
Taco tuesday is awesome&&&&ambience
It's a little off the beaten path in old town and the type of people that come here seem to be good people&&&&food
One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale both because of the service, tacos, Shiner, and the very cool look of the place&&&&ambience+food+service
You cannot get live honky tonk music like this anywhere close&&&&ambience
Did I say LIVE music? yes, I did&&&&ambience
We went there on a Saturday night, I guess the weekend it opened&&&&service
It is next to the Scottsdale Comedy Club, which by the way if you have not tried, must go&&&&food
they had a full bar, nice décor and great service&&&&ambience+food+service
the hush puppies lack flavor,&&&&food
again if you're drunk, anything fried is good&&&&food
The only criticism I can make is the place is small and it would have been nice if there was a patio to get away for some air&&&&ambience+food
I'd go back to enjoy the live music, drinks and try out their menu which is quite good in price&&&&ambience+cost+food
Great Venue, Good Food, Terrible Service&&&&food+service
We were completely ignored, waited forever to get our food order taken and I had to take up my soda to the bar to get a refill&&&&ambience+food+service
We were planning on going out to eat before getting to The Western,&&&&food
after hitting traffic we thought we'd play it safe and just eat at the venue&&&&food
00 we thought the doors would be open to serve food,&&&&food+service
when they say doors open and 7&&&&service
30, they open at 7&&&&service
30 rolled around and we were told the doors would be opening at 7&&&&service
45 instead&&&&food
45, doors didn't open&&&&service
00, doors didn't open&&&&service
15, 15 minutes after the show was suppose to start we got in and we grabbed one of the first tables we saw, right at the front near the stage&&&&ambience+food
A waitress came around and asked if we'd been helped, we said no and ordered a Coke (which was 90% ice) and PBR&&&&food+service
mentioned that we'd be ordering food tonight&&&&food+service
Then about a minute later another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said yes and assumed they a communication or organizational issue&&&&food
About 5 minutes later a bartender brought over our drinks and we started noticing food being brought out to the booths behind us&&&&ambience+food
We overheard the people behind us get asked if they wanted food to eat twice, yet our waitress walked right by us&&&&food
the opening band had already begun to play so it was difficult to get anyone's attention&&&&service
After being ready for 15 minutes, and watching everyone else get their food orders, our waitress came back and we finally got our order in&&&&food+service
we got the grilled cheese and a burger&&&&food
We got our food about 5 minutes later, which was okay, nothing special&&&&food
At that point we were so hungry would have been happy if they just brought us over some Taco Bell&&&&ambience
About halfway through the meal, we both ran out of drinks, down to the last drop of watered down Coke&&&&ambience+food
We began another round of find your waitress as our food got cold&&&&ambience+food
After about 5 minutes of trying I just gave up and walked over to the end of the bar with my empty glass&&&&ambience+food
Our waitress walked over to the bar and since the bartender was busy I asked her for another Coke and PBR&&&&ambience+food
She brought over our drinks and we finished our meal&&&&ambience+food
Then the fastest service we got was her bringing us the bill&&&&cost+food+service
Maybe we picked a bad table&&&&ambience
I definitely will be eating somewhere else beforehand&&&&food
Good brisket, quest, and burger&&&&food
The ambiance is very dark&&&&ambience
There is a good sound system and entertainment many nights&&&&ambience
There is a nice dance floor for when dancing is available&&&&food
most of the recorded music is certainly good for dancing county and western&&&&ambience
Like many others have said, great place to get away from the usual old town hustle&&&&food
Sunday's w/ Sara Robinson are awesome&&&&ambience
Most of their musicians are good and the staff has always been friendly&&&&ambience+service
So the doorman told me I missed a few songs of his set and right when I was about to pay, the woman running the show told him they're not taking any more money at the door&&&&ambience+cost
I guess they were closing the books or whatever - so I got in free&&&&ambience
Place was already packed to the gills with folks and there wasn't a whole lot of room to expand outward since there are mostly tables once you pass the main floorspace&&&&ambience
Sound was decent - it was just a duo with no drumkit so that would have been hard to mess up&&&&ambience
Can't complain because I didn't pay a cent for the whole experience and didn't even bother to get a drink&&&&cost+food
Managed to skip the openers and see just what I wanted&&&&service
Parking isn't too much of a problem even if it's crowded - you can keep driving E&&&&ambience
5th avenue until you see some open parking spots&&&&ambience+service
I found a space just before I hit Goldwater Blvd&&&&food
Great live music and atmosphere&&&&ambience+food
I would have liked to see 10 wings as opposed to 8, since the charge was equivalent to the burgers&&&&cost+food
For dessert we had the apple cobbler which was amazing&&&&food
I would definitely order that again&&&&service
The service was excellent&&&&food+service
All of the staff were very friendly and quick&&&&service
I wound up here after taking a life-threatening, drunken jaywalk across Indian School from The Valley Ho&&&&food
Needless to say, I made it safely across (and back) and had a GREAT time&&&&food
It's definitely one of the more genuine country places you'll find in The Valley and definitely at the top of my list for taking in some live music&&&&ambience
They pull off the rustic, country decor well and they have a country/chuck wagon inspired menu to boot&&&&ambience
I did not sample the food I just knocked back a few beers courtesy of the friendly, efficient bar staff who took good care of me and helped contri&&&&ambience+food+service
you'll find a more mature, well-behaved crowd and a more mellow environment more conducive to having fun than seeing and being seen&&&&ambience
This is equally good to come for drinks and eats as it is for drinking and tearing up the dance floor so I am looking forward to coming back soon and getting my two-step on---4&&&&food
Great food, good beers, fried oreos&&&&food
Had the wings and a burger this time&&&&food
Service was outstanding and if we were in the mood we would have stayed for the music that was setting up during dinner&&&&ambience+food+service
Great non-stereotypical Scottsdale scene for Scottsdale&&&&food
They had a country band playing on Wednesday and they were decent enough if you like that music&&&&ambience
It's like they undercharged me - strange&&&&cost
Tried the nachos and they were a fairly big portion loaded with ground beef and lots of black beans and sour cream&&&&ambience+food
The sauce was a cheese sauce, not real melted cheese&&&&food
Another gorgeous bartender was patrolling behind the bar as well&&&&ambience+food
Not crowded at happy Hour&&&&ambience
The Western is definitely worthy&&&&cost
Staff was friendly, prompt, and knew the menu&&&&service
The server (was quizzed)  had great recommendations&&&&food
and, and, the sound system for their performers is great&&&&ambience+food
It's off the beaten path,&&&&food
Food is lousy mainly because waitress does not listen&&&&food
Music is great&&&&ambience+food
eat elsewhere first&&&&food
Even trying to fix errors the food is only less&&&&food
Have not eaten in 9 hours so very hungry and still skipped much of it&&&&food
Need better wait staff and kitchen---1&&&&service
Situated in a hidden street just away from the hustle and bustle of Old Town, classy cowboys are welcomed into this new country establishment&&&&service
It's not your typical honky tonk bar though&&&&ambience
No here the lights are dim, the decor is country chic and the vibe is country classy&&&&ambience
I especially like the live bands they have and the dance floor that invites visitors to enjoy the music&&&&ambience
I have yet to try the food&&&&food
For not paying a cover, the band here was fantastic&&&&cost
The drinks were delicious and very reasonably priced&&&&cost+food
I noticed a small little section of the restaurant right off the dance floor that looked like it was reserved for a private party&&&&ambience+food+service
The service was also pretty fast and on top of things&&&&food+service
Don't go here for the food or the service&&&&food+service
If you like to drink and country music&&&&ambience+food
The food is mediocre and service really really slow&&&&food+service
It took an hour and a half for me to get a kale chicken caesar salad&&&&food
Thanks for telling me that when I placed my order from their menu with that salad on it&&&&food+service
And my sister's burger was suppose to have a fried egg on top&&&&food
When they served it they forgot to tell her they ran out of eggs&&&&food
They should just shut the kitchen down and serve drinks with the live bands&&&&food
The rest of the food in my group was bland and the manager comped the food because "they couldn't handle" business with another party of 75&&&&ambience+food+service
There are way too many fantastic places to eat in Scottsdale&&&&food
We don't need this lame excuse for food&&&&food
If they stay in business it will truly only be due to the music and drinks&&&&ambience+food
Scottsdale&&&&food
Don't eat at The Western&&&&food
Your welcome&&&&service
I typically do not eat BBQ,&&&&food

Seriously, they work in old town Scottsdale AND they are nice / pleasant / outgoing / cordial / amazing&&&&food
Do you know how hard that is to find in Old Town Scottsdale? 3&&&&food
They were really nice to my mom&&&&food
That gets kudos in my book&&&&ambience
All of the food was super fantastic - from the salmon to the all-your-fat-ass-can-eat-Sunday-special (which I got)&&&&food
My mom literally ate her entire salmon fillet, rice pilaf, corn husk, and licked the plate so hard I think she bore a hole in it&&&&ambience+food
I ate the pork&&&&food
t sliders + coleslaw + ribs + chicken + yes = happy Siobhan&&&&food
I randomly found this place through Groupon and I am very pleasantly surprised&&&&ambience
They have a sweet happy hour from 5pm to 7pm&&&&food
half off appetizers + cheap drinks&&&&cost+food
Western?In conclusion, this is a newer place with live music, awesome food, and even better staff&&&&ambience+food+service
Sweet mother mary of jesus, YES, YES, YES&&&&food
Great live music with no cover&&&&ambience+food
The bar is awesome and made of textured leather, and they have some delicious mixed drinks if you are in the mood for something a little different&&&&ambience+food
Fried pickles and Ranch&&&&food
The food is delicious and the vibe is so laid back and welcoming&&&&food+service

I was also happy to hear that they were have great drink specials&&&&food
If you have ever dreamed of an heirloom tomato salad with chicken, it's from here&&&&ambience+food
I'm obsessed--I'm quietly pining for it now&&&&ambience
As far as live music goes, this place has two flavors&&&&ambience+food
I have only been here on the latter-type of night and it was always great&&&&food
Check ahead about the music if you're a snob either way&&&&ambience
Love the community tables, love the bison head, love the wallpaper, love the stage, love Eric the bartender, LOVE&&&&ambience+food
Deeds makes the best Butter Chicken in the world&&&&food
Find Flavor Chalet and try it, you will not be disappointed&&&&food
Flavor Chalet was one of the food tracks being served at the Capital Lawn&&&&food
I order a side of french fries and grilled cheese&&&&food+service
The large image behind the truck and his whiteboard suggested fresh thin cut fries&&&&ambience+food
But the fries he was setting up was from a frozen bag and they weren't thin cut at all, just large soft fries that he had to prepare the oil to deep fried them on&&&&food
He also took a long time just getting prepared to make my grilled cheese&&&&food
In short, he was very disorganized and at least 3 people who were waiting on him to take new orders, left&&&&service
He spend almost 10min working on my food, he didn't bother to take new orders&&&&food+service
The fries were bad as expected and the grilled cheese tasted funky&&&&food
He didn't used american sliced cheese,&&&&food
used shredded cheese&&&&food
He also used 2 regular size breads you get at Fry's&&&&food
For these two orders, I paid $12&&&&cost+service
In addition, his idea of curry meal on the whiteboard showed a large plate nicely prepared with the toppings&&&&ambience+food
I saw a guy ordering it and he got a small Styrofoam bowl with some premade curry served in it&&&&ambience+food+service
That cost him $6&&&&cost
Took a total of 20min to get my order&&&&service
Microwavable food&&&&food
Swindles you to pay for something that you didn't order&&&&cost+service
Avoid at all costs&&&&cost
This was the worst experience at a food truck ever&&&&food
All of the "Specials of the day" items that he had displayed on his white board were not available&&&&ambience
He heated up one last hamburger patty (not fresh) for my young daughter and put the patty on a stale hot dog bun&&&&ambience+food
No lettuce, no tomatoes, etc&&&&ambience+food
I asked for a plain bean & cheese burrito for my other young daughter and he put rice & curry in it&&&&food
what part of PLAIN beans & cheese did he not understand&&&&food
wanted to charge me FULL price for my order plus the burrito and hotdog hamburger&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
I told him that it was not a fair price and he was arguing with me about it- I will never eat here again and I will let many friends know about this experience&&&&ambience+cost+food
It's aiming for a fresh, Mediterranean feel as the owners are Italian&&&&ambience+food
Inside it's clean and light with a small number of tables and an impressive deli counter with fresh ingredients&&&&ambience+food
The service is friendly and the menu offers a good selection of cakes, sandwiches and Italian specialities like pizzas, calzones and pasta dishes&&&&food+service
I had a ham and pineapple pizza which only took about five minutes to be prepared and tasted amazing&&&&food
The base was nice and crisp and the topping was delicious with good quality cheese&&&&food
Not only was it tasty,&&&&food
it was filling too and only cost £4&&&&cost
It's a shame Elm Rose doesn't do more business as it offers friendly, quick service and great food at reasonable prices&&&&cost+food+service
The inside is small, with around 5 or 6 tables set out, each with a couple of chairs&&&&ambience
The right hand wall was occupied by a drinks chiller, with a chiller doubling as a counter at the back&&&&ambience+food
They serve the normal cafe range of items - drinks, small cakes, and no doubt paninis and sandwiches as well&&&&food
Staff greeted me with a smile, and though I only bought one small piece of cake, I would love to be able to go back and sample some more of their food&&&&food+service
Elm Rose, with its neat Rennie Mackintosh styling, offers good quality soup, sandwiches and other lunchtime treats&&&&ambience+food
It's well worth a visit, next time you're in the neighbourhood&&&&cost
There's much to be said for places that keep things smart and simple, and that's the category into which Elm Rose neatly fits&&&&ambience+food
) has the most tempting counter of food&&&&ambience+food
Situated on Elm Row, I would personally rather grab a bite here to go, or eat at home, as it is quite small&&&&food
the quality of the food can't be questioned&&&&food
The staff were extremely friendly, and a woman who worked there assured me there'd be a change of menu by the following week if she could be bothered&&&&service
I appreciate the numerous specials boards outside the cafe, as the food changes quite often and doesn't start to bore the customers&&&&ambience+food
They've got a clever lay out, as they offer ciabatas, baked potatoes, baguettes, wraps and rolls which can be finished off with any fillings you choose yourself from the counter&&&&ambience+food
The baked potato with chicken filling I had was really good, and to top it off, they are quite cheap as well&&&&ambience+cost+food
the staff(owners?) did not seem happy to see customers when the 5 of us walked in&&&&service
My chicken panini was all bread with almost no chicken except a few paper thin scraps&&&&food
Good place to grab a bite&&&&food
A colleague raved about their baked potatoe which I tried and was positively stuffed&&&&ambience+food
Had a Mexican wrap today, which came with salad and coleslaw&&&&food
Tasted great, would recommend as also have prompt service&&&&food+service
I found this lovely little café on route to a yoga class on a sunny Saturday morning, desperate for some caffeine and a minimal breakfast which would complain if I spent lots of time bending over and touching my toes&&&&ambience+cost
There is a well stacked bookshelf in the corner by the counter, and a world map on the wall by the door with a request to 'pin where you've travelled'&&&&ambience
It has a few tables&&&&ambience
ended up with an Americano and some yoghurt coated raisins which were very satisfactory&&&&food
The menu was vast though, featuring a variety of hot and cold snacks, and even Turkish coffee&&&&ambience+food
They have a few small tables and plenty of sandwiches, salads and soups to choose from&&&&ambience+food
I liked the buffalo chicken wraps, the falafel and the soups&&&&food
I found myself going back there a few times when I was staying in Edinburgh recently because the owners were friendly and the food was very good and freshly made&&&&ambience+food+service
I stopped here to meet a friend for a quick coffee and cake session, and I was surprised to see it because I have passed the place loads of times and just never noticed it&&&&food
This is a wee traditional caff, selling lunch food like paninis, toasties and a selection of hot meals&&&&ambience+food
The cakes were superb- my scone with jam and cream was divine coupled with a cup of milky tea- heaven or what?It was a cute and comfortable place to sit, and even though it was small we never felt rushed to leave&&&&ambience+food
The food is the usual fast food&&&&food
I always go since it's close and the service were good&&&&food+service
However, it all changed when they changed the manager from the older male manager to a new small female asian manager&&&&service
The old manager is very patient and very chatty and friendly&&&&service
this new manager is very impatient and rude to customers&&&&service
I was there to order the new grilled bagel and she at first mistaken that I wanted a bagel&&&&food+service
When I cleared it up so that she has to make a modification on the order, everyone can hear her muttering "oh god&&&&ambience+service
Then I specifically asked for a combo and when she gave me the food, there is no hush brown&&&&food
When I ask her about it, she just said annoyingly that she did not charge me and walked away&&&&cost
As a client, I can accept mistakes in the order as long as everything is clarified, either make the order right and charge me for the difference or apologize and let me know there isn't much she can do about it&&&&cost+service
However, her behavior is not setting a good example to the other employees and I sincerely hope that they change the manager for this store&&&&service
Terrible service&&&&food+service
The French fries were the worst I have ever eaten&&&&food
Coffee is good and hot though&&&&ambience+food
I usually come here before work on weekends and pick up a hot chocolate and a crate of TimBits&&&&ambience+cost+food
Service is a little slow, and they never have enough Timbits ti fill out my box, they only have the "leftovers" of the jelly filled once, which I try and avoid&&&&food+service
They lack donut selection, like there is not enough, or they are already out of stock at 8am&&&&food
I grab and go, its cheap and good, just missing the selection&&&&cost+food
If I had to complain, I would say that they pack the place a little too tight with the tables&&&&ambience
inexpensive doesn't have to mean gross&&&&service
that place hasn't been cleaned in ages, the baskets hanging from the ceiling are so dustry, it makes me want to vomit&&&&ambience
the food is diner-quality and their cooked apples are gross (plus i hate cooked apples)&&&&food
it's small and stuffy and reminds me of a dirty grandmother's house&&&&ambience
the only reason they're still open is because Montreal has loads of cheapos&&&&cost+service
Great place for brunch, very intimate seating&&&&ambience+food+service
Great meals with clearly very fresh ingredients&&&&ambience+food
A gem of Plateau&&&&ambience+food
The food's pretty good, and there are lots of options, although it has a bit of that all-tasting-the-same problem that sometimes happens at brunch places&&&&food
feel kind of crowded when you're eating&&&&ambience+food
On se demande toujours pourquoi les gens aiment faire la ligne le samedi matin à seule fin de se faire servir des oeufs-bacon, avec une tranche de melon et deux rondelles de banane&&&&ambience+food
J'aime beaucoup, personnellement, les röstis, galettes de pommes de terre rapées, agrémentées de fromage, d'olive, de tomate, de bacon, ou autre selon celle que l'on choisit&&&&ambience+food
Ils font aussi d'excellentes pancakes à l'avoine&&&&food
Pourquoi pas une étoile de plus alors ?Parce qu'ils ne savent pas faire un expresso convenable (et c'est vraiment le MOINS qu'on puisse dire)&&&&ambience+food
On m'a expliqué que c'était le plus court que la machine pouvait faire&&&&ambience
Mais tout de même, pour un resto à déjeuner, ne pas pouvoir faire un café décent&&&&ambience
They have a lot a choices and it's inexpensive&&&&food
The place is very cute and decorated like a farm&&&&ambience+cost+food
I had eggs florentine on english muffins and smoked salmon with a hollandaise sauce&&&&food
It comes with hash-brown potatoes and sweet & warm apples&&&&ambience+food
The bill was less than $12&&&&cost
Le service, l'ambiance, la deco&&&&food+service
(we finally got there at night by driving lol) We're walking around Plateau Mont Royal's main road and just went in out of hunger and exhaustion&&&&ambience+food
Great bread as a side and the satisfying quantity can feed Americans&&&&food
lol Servers were speaking fairly good English so don't be afraid to join locals of Montreal +_+&&&&ambience
Well if you need coffee, its as you would expect at Tims&&&&food
The line up is always big and the service is very slow for a Tims&&&&food+service
Despite a renovation to update the appearance they still can't get your order right&&&&food+service
Tonight I ordered two teas at the drive thru and when I got home it turned out they were both coffee despite being labeled as tea&&&&food+service
Often this location is out of the item you want and take way too long to put your order together especially compared to many other Tim Horton's locations nearby&&&&service
Super friendly staff&&&&service
Unique selection of donuts that you wont always find at other locations&&&&food
By the way if you're going to come here to meet with someone, make sure that you order something&&&&service
They actually keep up on people sitting around and whether they are ordering stuff&&&&service
This location keeps tabs on people because it certain times of the day there are a lot of young whippersnappers hanging out and not ordering&&&&service
Lovely vegetarian cafe that serves good big portions of wholesome meals&&&&food
If you can't decide what to have at the counter, you can pick and mix, having 2 half portions of main courses for instance, or a main course and a couple of salads&&&&ambience+food
There is a noticeboard, and often artists exhibit on the walls&&&&ambience+food
'Susie's' est un resto très informelle avec plein de nourriture végétariénne, bio, commerce équitable etc&&&&ambience
Très populaire avec les étudiants d'Edimbourg&&&&ambience
Susie's Diner is somewhere to go when you've indulged beyond the pale and your body is suffering physical guilt and demanding some healthy comfort&&&&ambience+food
Generous portions of delicious vegetarian fare are the order of the day&&&&cost+food+service
They have a system where you can choose various configurations of salads, quiches and hot dishes for set prices in a canteen-esque set up&&&&ambience+cost+food
Prices are generally around £3-£7&&&&cost+food
The mix 'n' match crockery together with the self-service food and drink give Susie's a very informal feeling and the casual décor of red painted walls, unvarnished tables and wooden benches all contri&&&&ambience+food+service
Feel-good food in a family friendly diner devoid of any pretension&&&&food+service
Located conveniently near george Square campus, this small albeit popular restaurant/cafe has a winning combination of great food, generous portions, good service and reasonable price ( also as a bonus, the 'guilt free' satisfaction of having eaten a vegetarian and organic meal)&&&&cost+food+service
Desserts and cakes are to die for&&&&food
The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is all smiles and you can linger over a meal and a conversation with a friend&&&&service
20pounds I got a small plate with one portion of hot food and some rice&&&&ambience+food
No salad or anything&&&&food
The service was also rude and abrupt&&&&food+service
I will say that the food was delicious (I made my small portion last as long as possible)&&&&food
next time I would go to the mosque kitchen next door and get a much larger meal for less without the dramatic service&&&&ambience+food+service
This place is where you will go when you are craving some home cooked food and cant get any&&&&food
The food is standard home cooked meal types cooked very well&&&&food
The servings are very generous which most will appreciate, although if some aren't too hungry it may be worth sharing&&&&cost+service
Susie's serves exclusively vegetarian food&&&&food
The atmosphere and ordering procedure is a little too student to make the night of it more canteen than restaurant&&&&service
However, the food is always great and there are plenty of pubs around for after&&&&food
You can find quick and tasty vegetarians options here&&&&food
I ate here several times while traveling alone in Edinburgh and felt very comfortable eating alone (not always the case at other places)&&&&ambience+food
I hope my 4 star rating isn't too generous&&&&service
Service is also lacklustre at times&&&&food+service
I really did enjoy the food when it was "on"&&&&food
I had the baked tortillas with goat cheese and shrimp, extremely tasty&&&&food
The service was friend, informative and really fast&&&&ambience+food+service
The food was prepared quickly and well presented&&&&food
Try the lime margaritas&&&&food
Courteous service&&&&food+service
the food is terrible&&&&food
I ordered the burrito which was cold and came with no noticeable cheese&&&&ambience+food+service
Beef stuffing was dry and the only flavour I tasted was salt&&&&food
- Very tasty, simple food&&&&food
- Reasonably priced, especially given the location&&&&cost+food
- Friendly, fast service&&&&food+service
- No vegetarian option for main dishes&&&&food
Vegetarian entrées were available and I was told that the burrito's meat/chicken could be swapped for grilled vegetables at the same price&&&&ambience+cost+food
Also, grilled vegetables are not a proper vegetarian choice in 2015, especially in a restaurant that features beans and cheese in so many other dishes&&&&ambience+food
Every table outdoors is adorned with a centerpiece of three beers (not included, just to be clear)&&&&ambience
The first two pages of the food menu are actually a drink menu&&&&food
When we were ready to order, with closed menus, our waitress reopened my menu to the drink pages and went on at great length about what was available&&&&food+service
I understand that restaurants need to sell alcohol to increase the average check price,&&&&cost+food
Good service, horrible food&&&&food+service
It came cold, and when i complained my food was cold (fridge cold) i was told its normal in a busy restaurant to cook all the food early in the morning and&&&&ambience+food
reheat it for service&&&&food+service
I respectfully declined that dish and paid for our appetizers and walked away&&&&cost
I realize how pretentious it is to review an airport Quiznos&&&&ambience
However, this $9 salad I just gave up on is particularly bad&&&&food
The tomatoes also taste like rancid little iced cubes&&&&ambience+food
However, I saw someone eating a sandwhich and was hungry so I asked the person how was it? They had an Italian sandwhich and said it was good&&&&food
I decided to go ahead and buy it because there weren't that many choices&&&&food
This could have been great or at the very least good,&&&&food
The sandwhich after having gone through the "toaster" was cold literally within 30 seconds&&&&ambience+food
The taste was not great&&&&food
There are only three places to eat and quiznos could easily be the spot to eat&&&&ambience+food
I paid $9 for a steak sandwich that had no steak&&&&cost+food
One paper thin slice of meat on one half of the foot long sub was all i got and everything is supposedly prepared ahead of time so they wont/cant fix it&&&&food
And the actual bread was salty&&&&food
way too salty&&&&food
and the sauce that came with it tastes like it was rancid&&&&food
The whole thing was inedible&&&&food
it's the airport&&&&ambience
Average Turkish/Middle Eastern cuisine place for kebabs&&&&food
The food prep time is atrocious (almost 30 mins) and the food isn't extraordinary&&&&food
I ordered the sandwich with lamb sandwich combo with salad and a soda&&&&food+service
The portion of salad is generous&&&&food+service
I can't finish the sandwich so I tried to pick the meat out of the bread and I found a suspicious hair probably a eyelash&&&&ambience+food
The worst part was that the owner wouldn't give us the receipt and charged five dollar more than what we should pay&&&&cost
I even asked did he include the tips in the bill&&&&cost
After he ""realized" he charged more&&&&cost
He said he thought we order one more soda&&&&food+service
What soda worth 5 dollars? That's totally a lie&&&&cost+food
He is not a honest man and he acted like it was our fault not telling him we took only two soda&&&&food
tic Turkish food it's like you have no choice&&&&food
to go here hoping that you'll get lucky and eat something  decent,&&&&food
unfortunately you can't eat anything good here&&&&food
First they don't know how to make doner , bulgur pilav is sooooo dry have absolutely no taste ,let's talk about so called Adana kebab now that's a total joke it's just a minced meat filled with cheap quality red pepper to make it spicy and hoping that it becomes what is supposed to be&&&&cost+food
with what kind of customers? Definitely majority of there customers don't have Turkish or let's say Armenian backgrounds , they cater to low budget middle eastern immigrants most of them from 3rd world country's where they don't have any idea what Turkish food is&&&&food
People who reads our reviews will see that so far we don't have 1 good review about Turkish restaurants in Ontario and Quebec , that's because we travel to Istanbul 4 to 6 times a year and we really know what Turkish kebab is  unfortunately there is not one decent Turkish kebab restaurant specially in Quebec&&&&food
Place looks like a old Middleastern mosque with all green walls , and the music that you hear while you eat? Omg in Turkish we say (AGIT) meaning? Sad crying song when someone dies this is the kind of music they listen at uncivilized Turkish villages&&&&ambience+food+service
Before I forget Shepard salad , ezme are sitting on the counter( not in the fridge) yes on the counter covered with Saran Wrap so it does not get dirty , you have to eat warm Shepard salad that's unfortunate&&&&ambience+food
))))) Is the place clean yes it is&&&&ambience
again that does not make the food good, Iam hoping 1 day In Montreal we will have a good Turkish kebab restaurants like Toronto or New York&&&&food
I had the mixed meat plate, which consisted of chicken, lamb and meatball kebab and some salads on the side&&&&ambience+food
One plate was plenty for two people&&&&ambience
all in all, the kebabs are alright, not bad for turkish/middle eastern kebabs,&&&&food
not quite worth coming all the way to NDG for either&&&&cost
The price was reasonable, around $14 for the large plate, which can be shared generously among two people&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Waited 20 minutes for two Chicken Kebab Sandwich for take out, and I was the only customer during dinner service&&&&food+service
The sandwich was extremely bland, with barely any seasoning, or lack thereof&&&&ambience
One more thing, the guy who was preparing my sandwich did not wash the lettuce I saw him chopped and he did not wash his hands after handling raw meat either&&&&food
I won't go as far as recommending McDonald's instead of this place,&&&&food
Subway is definitely a wiser choice&&&&food
My friend was raving about this, saying it's as good as Antep (as if)I took the mixed plate, very little meat and was still hungry&&&&ambience+food
No rice, just some salad and a bulgur type of side&&&&food
Bread was good,&&&&food
meat felt re-heated&&&&food
Went twice, the first and the last&&&&food
If it wasn't for the amount of time you must wait until your friggin sandwich gets prepared (between 20-25 minutes&&&&cost+food
Although one can quip about their mediocre decor or lack thereof, I can only talk positive about the bread they use which is ok, not too fluffy and slightly crispy after it's grilled&&&&ambience+food
Oh and they change their menu prices quite often and I once got charged the older higher price when it was time to pay&&&&cost+food
Nice Decor, mediocre food&&&&ambience+food
Dropped by for all you can eat (AYCE) lunch&&&&food
Now for that price, don't order any raw fish dishes&&&&cost+food+service
It won't be 'jumped out of the water' fresh&&&&ambience+food
The soups were good - a bit starchy&&&&food
the hot and sour tasted fine&&&&ambience+food
Thai mango salad - skip&&&&food
The mango was nice&&&&food
the sauce was awkward&&&&food
I would highly recommend the teriaki chicken&&&&food
I found their grilled dishes to be piping hot and crisp&&&&ambience+food
The service was quite attentive&&&&food+service
you had better keep track of what you ordered&&&&service
Hence why I can't comment on the dim sum, it never arrived&&&&ambience
Actually, service is worst, you order something and they bring it partly and slow&&&&food+service
While having all you can eat menu, even you order more they don't bring it to you and they have no explanation for it&&&&food+service
right now service is too careless&&&&food+service
Lovely restaurant and lots of great options to choose from&&&&food
The servers were great and the atmosphere was lovely&&&&food
Drinks are reasonably priced, too&&&&cost+food
The sushi was okay- not top bar&&&&ambience
Great place&&&&food
Lunch all you can eat for 12&&&&food
Can't go wrong with the Malay rice and noodle dishes&&&&food
Good service&&&&food+service
They've removed the all you can eat&&&&food
not worth it now&&&&cost
For all you can eat this is very good&&&&food
99 for lunch and it's all you can eat sushi, thai, Chinese and some Dim Sum&&&&ambience+food
For the sushi I would recommend the fiery dragon which is dragon roll with a nice sauce on top&&&&food
Thai pad thai and hot and spicy chicken are nice too&&&&ambience+food
The mango salad and the dim sum were only ok&&&&ambience+food
for the price it's DEF worth it&&&&cost+food
extra $1 for soft drinks with free refills (good deal)&&&&food
The food wasn't bad,&&&&food
the chicken wasn't fresh, there was a weird taste to it&&&&ambience+food
Service was bad though&&&&food+service
Solo diners get ignored&&&&service
That I can deal with since I have been to a lot of Asian restaurants in the past with no service&&&&food+service
But this was worse because the manager was actually quite rude&&&&service
And I got the impression that he is trying to control how much you order&&&&service
I might stay away until service improves&&&&food+service
SKIP the dim sum and go for the sushi instead&&&&ambience+food
That and it's name doesn't seem that prominent, I thought Hot and Spicy was the description&&&&ambience+food
it looks pretty fancy inside, kinda shiny, and the waiters and waitresses use littler ipad things to take your order&&&&ambience+service
But they were quite friendly, I guess they should be since it was only us and one or 2 people getting take out&&&&service
My friend got the mango chicken, and I ordered a lunch special of grilled teriyaki salmon&&&&food+service
The special was great, it came with a really good hot and sour soup, some dark organic rice and your typical kind of salad&&&&ambience+food
The mango chicken was good&&&&food
And it costed about $5 more since it wasn't a special&&&&cost
I think overall the regular menu is a little pricey for me compared to other things nearby&&&&cost+food
And the service was a-ok&&&&food+service
Just came back from the AYCE Lunch & gonna write & rate as I can still remember it&&&&cost
Miso Soup (3&&&&food

- We were able to get a seat when we arrived at 1&&&&food
00 Bottomless pop soooo good, not watered down at all&&&&food
Nice atmosphere to sit in&&&&food
- Service was quick & *SUPER* friendlyCONS&&&&food+service
- Dim sum items weren't that great - its like they needed more salt&&&&ambience+food
- Didn't have the wonton soup when I ordered it, so I went for Hot & Sour instead&&&&ambience+food+service
- The food here is kind of like Manchu Wok/Szechuan-Szechuan type food, with the addition of Sushi though  - Even though it says on the menu they will charge $2&&&&cost+food
00 for each item not consumed, they didn't charge us, even though we had about 3 half-dishes of uneaten items left&&&&ambience+cost+food
, you don't wanna be facing west cause the sun will be shining in your face&&&&ambience
=)  The food could use some work though&&&&food
We ordered a soup and a noodle dish&&&&food+service
The noodle dish arrived and was placed on my side of the table&&&&ambience
The soup never arrived&&&&food
When we  asked about it the waiter said we only talked about the soup&&&&food+service
didn't order it&&&&service
Lesson learned repeat the order or ask the waiter to repeat the order&&&&food+service
Went down the street to Ginger to finish the meal&&&&food
today, the service was confused and slow&&&&food+service
The food was ok&&&&food
There are better choices in the neighbourhood&&&&food
They were slow taking my order, 10 minutes later another waiter brought me another menu&&&&ambience+food+service
Kung Pow Chicken was ok and&&&&food
it took some effort to get my bill&&&&cost
The restaurant was empty so we were excited to have dedicated service&&&&food+service
Decor is modern and appears fairly clean&&&&ambience+food
Very slow and incompetent service, despite being one of the only families at the restaurant&&&&food+service
They kept getting our order wrong and bringing out duplicate dishes&&&&service
An hour in to dinner we still did not receive our sushi and had to place our order again2&&&&service
"Cooked" dim sum dishes coming to the table rawWould not come back and would not recommend&&&&ambience+food
Been at this spot a few times so I wanted to give it a few takes prior to giving it a fair review&&&&ambience
The food is very bland&&&&food
Any request for spicy food results in them tossing in chili flakes&&&&food
At Salad King they use fresh peppers&&&&ambience+food
When I was in Thailand, they use fresh peppers&&&&ambience+food
The peppers should be infused in the meal&&&&food
Service?  I have only gone through take out, 3 times&&&&ambience+food+service
I had to go back and forth from my office to the restaurant since they messed up my order twice&&&&food+service
THREE trips to that location for 1 order is unacceptable&&&&ambience+service
The manager I met a few weeks back is super friendly&&&&service
Worst food and service I have received in a long long time&&&&food+service
Got all you can eat&&&&food
Our second round of order got lost somehow&&&&service
Waited almost 30 mins for the food to come&&&&food
The manager was extremely rude&&&&service
That manager should be fired yesterday, if he even cared&&&&service
Had the all you can eat and it really surprised at the variety of food offered&&&&food
Salmon carpaccio is definitely worth trying as well as the thai basiil eggplant&&&&cost+food
don't expect service&&&&food+service
they are friendly&&&&service
The food is great and I am ready to tackle the AYCE&&&&food
Might go there today with my family if it's open for Xmas&&&&service
dish is the sweet and sour fish&&&&food
Dropped by for dinner before a movie at Scotiatheatre&&&&food
Should have walked a few extra steps to the more well known and well rated places&&&&cost
Dinner is not all you can eat,&&&&food
Besides the green tea, nothing was ok&&&&food
Hot and sour soup was commercial and average (probably better than anything else we ate)&&&&ambience+food
Chicken in black bean sauce was so bland and bad (even though we asked for spicy)&&&&food
Fried rice was meh&&&&food
Sui mai and har gow were glutinous and barely had flavour&&&&ambience
Just looks clean and neat and spacious&&&&ambience+food
Walk a few extra steps to Queen Mother or even Ginger&&&&food
Or Trimurti Indian food across the road&&&&food
so going out to eat was a big deal&&&&food
My memories of it when being a child were all of people that I was with, and not the food, and now I think I know why&&&&food
If the food was as bland back&&&&food
I have dined at this Country Kitchen on several occaisions after movies at the UltraStar Theater (they should drop the Ultra&&&&food
)  and I have brought my family here several times for breakfast or quick lunches etc&&&&ambience
Country Kitchen is a lateral move from Dennys and IHOP, with a slightly better focus on service however given the area I know that service will be the first thing to go&&&&ambience+food+service
When the have-nots barely speak english and disrepect the community it shows and it takes it's toll on the service people&&&&ambience+food+service
It is a bit pricey for what you get&&&&cost+food
So if you must eat here, bring a coupon or the bill will somewhat infuriate you due to the wholly unexceptional food&&&&cost+food
Without a coupon expect to pay 15-20% more than a Dennys or Village Inn for about the same food&&&&cost+food
On the bright side, I have had lunch here several times and really enjoyed the Reuben, so there is at least one sandwich that has some flavor and was not a dissapointment&&&&food
So there we have it, if you are dragged here to eat, get a Reuben&&&&food
We get takeout from CK every month or so, and it's pretty solid 'American' food&&&&food
At the same time, if you are looking for 'wild and exciting' at a place called Country Kitchen, you're probably going to be disappointed no matter what&&&&ambience
I almost gave them 4 stars based on their seasonal breadbowl soups&&&&ambience+food
try the pot roast soup, that was our favorite&&&&ambience+food
not because they have awesome food&&&&ambience+food
Nick's offered a "buy one get one free" coupon on the back of Fry's grocery store receipts so me and my girlfriend took advantage of that quite a few times until they stopped the promotion&&&&food
The unfortunate thing about Nick's is the pictures of the food in the menu are great, what you get served looks nothing like it&&&&food
The food is average at best, me and my girlfriend joked that we wouldn't come back if it weren't for the BOGO deal they were offering&&&&food
The restaurant looks nice, it's clean&&&&ambience+food
The hostess and wait staff are all very friendly&&&&service
The food quality and chef expertise is lacking horribly&&&&food
This manager is a chauvinist pig, he has fired me because he has gotten a complaint on himself, he has made sexual comments to almost everyone that works there and is a very rude person&&&&service
it's a 'honey & y'all' accent&&&&food
D She had a very friendly disposition & made our lunch experience a pleasure&&&&ambience+service
The food was decent AND you can have breakfast all day&&&&food
)The building is fairly new, not too brightly lit & clean&&&&ambience
I've been eating at this CK since they opened&&&&food+service
I probably go once or twice a month for breakfast, and occasionally for lunch / dinner&&&&food
They've changed managers several times, and can never seem to get a good one&&&&service
I have no met the current one, I just noticed that the last one I met is no longer there&&&&food
The waitresses are usually great&&&&food
The breakfast food is pretty standard&&&&food
Pancakes, waffles, omelets, and all the usual breakfast meats&&&&food
Their burgers are decent,&&&&food
Their all you can eat rib or fish & chips nights are a pretty good deal,&&&&food
I'm not really impressed by their dinner food&&&&food
However, I've never had anything that wasn't good enough for me to eat till I'm full&&&&food
As the mom of  2 kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people don't give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carraba's)&&&&ambience+food
We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good&&&&food
Not great,&&&&food
I will say though that their french fries are some of the best I've had&&&&food
Despite Christine S and her stellar review, I'd have to say "Surprise you can do better" I've eaten country kitchen 3 times at time of this review, the food is nothing denny's IHOP or village inn don't offer, I'm a bit of a sucker for fish fry's so the one time we actually dined in, I had the fish fry and it's not bad,&&&&food
we've gotten their breakfast to go on a lazy weekend morning, the pancakes are decent, however my breakfast seemed to be kind of sparse on meat, the other night we got back from happy hour and appetizers with some coworkers of mine and we were still hungry, not feeling like fast food we call up country kitchen and order an order of their sliders and 2 milkshakes&&&&food+service
so I wait about 10-15 minutes, leave my house which is about 2 mi away, arrive at the restaurant to find it completely barren at about 7&&&&ambience+food
30PM, I approach the counter and the manager just continues to mess with his blackberry never looking up eventually, a hostess comes from the back and greets me, mind you it's already been 15 minutes and all they need to do was grill some small beef pattys and drop some fries, I still end up waiting another 10 minutes for my food, only to have everyone disappear into the back of the restaurant again to have another server come out confused and try to seat me&&&&ambience+food+service
eventually I get the food, the sliders aren't bad,&&&&food
3 sliders could potentially cause a rift in some relationships, the decor is an orgy of applebees, IHOP and denny's&&&&ambience+food
imagine if you arrived  at the "campy wall crap" store only to find they'd already been cleaned out by an applebees corporate decorator, the decorations range from giant utensils, wireframe art, sports posters and scenic views&&&&ambience+cost+food
unfortunately Country Kitchen is the closest full service restaurant to my home so I will probably end up back here some lazy saturday morning picking up eggs and pancakes&&&&food+service
I was excited to see Surprise Pointe being built and to see more services coming closer to me, so far I've only seen more of the same&&&&food+service
This was a great place to stop and eat breakfast&&&&food
I enjoyed the fact that we were seated quickly and that they had the games on the TV&&&&food
It felt like I was at home eating breakfast&&&&food
I was in the mood for something with cheese and eggs,&&&&food
not an omelet, so I ordered the Skillet Scramble with a side of toast&&&&service
Taste was great and the portion size was plenty (I did not finish it)&&&&food
Overpriced and boring&&&&cost+food
There is nothing overly creative or unique about any of their menu offerings&&&&food
Very limited menu, especially for healthier or vegetarian options&&&&food
Don't be fooled by their claim to "the best pancakes in town"&&&&food
according to their website, 5 new Country Kitchen franchises are due to open in the Phoenix area&&&&service
Food quality and selection is at the Denny's quality&&&&food
Service was decent and food quality was decent&&&&food+service
Most of the food is good, sometimes the fish portion sizes vary, once my husband ordered it and it was huge the next time is was like 3 times smaller&&&&food+service
Service varies it just depends on who you get&&&&food+service
Also the assistant night manager is rude&&&&service
We took our 4 kids out to dinner since it was my daughters 10th birthday and was refused service since it was close to closing time&&&&food+service
56 pm and the sign on the window said they closed @9&&&&service
Was told they channged the hours to close at 8 so we could not be served even though we were already in the restaurant ready to be seated&&&&food
Quite good for simple food&&&&food
My wife and I have been to the Country Kitchen twice now and we have really enjoyed it&&&&food
Very attentive and friendly&&&&service
On to the food&&&&food
On my first visit I had the blue cheese burger with fries&&&&food
the Burger was very juicy and tender topped with a good quality blue cheese&&&&food
The fries were crispy and you could actually taste potato, not salt and grease&&&&ambience+food
On our second trip my wife and I started with the loaded potato skins with a side of ranch&&&&ambience+food
The server brought it out because we had asked to have a side of it with our burger to dip there oh so yummy onion rings in&&&&ambience+food
) The potato skins had to be some of the best we have had&&&&ambience+food
they were piled with there four cheese blend and crisp bacon&&&&food
My wife and I split the big BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and it did not disappoint&&&&food
The brought it out already cut and on two separate plates with an equal amount of onion rings on each&&&&ambience+cost+food
The burger was juicy and the BBQ sauce did not over power the beef&&&&food
The service was stellar and the food was good&&&&food+service
So stop on in and enjoy great service and good food&&&&food+service
I think this is a great neighborhood place to grab a meal&&&&food
The service is always professional & friendly&&&&food+service
Other people have compared this place to Denny's and in my opinion it's a much nicer dining experience&&&&food
First of all it's open and not all cramped and it's CLEAN&&&&ambience+service
The food is good, a nice variety on the menu&&&&food
This establishment is a great addition to the neighborhood&&&&food
This place is great for breakfast and however many cups of coffee the help remember to fill&&&&ambience+food
I overheard an argument between a customer and the manager about a brown steak&&&&food+service
Have an alibi ready in case you run into any problems with your order&&&&service
I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to&&&&food
But if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch&&&&food
apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal&&&&food
Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture&&&&food
There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet&&&&food
I should have also noticed something was "up" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot&&&&food
But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal&&&&food+service
Besides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap&&&&ambience+cost+food
I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient&&&&food
We have been going here for years, I mean lots of years for the crab legs, mostly because they brought them out at  a reasonable pace which is to say not slowly&&&&ambience+food+service
As of a few months ago if they felt someone was eating too many they started slowing down or deliberately bringing out "skunky" legs, the ones that taste real fishy and aren't really all that well cooked&&&&cost+food
On a recent visit the owner, a Chinese man in his late 40's or 50's actually yelled at a customer at length in Chinese  for eating too many crab legs&&&&food
I have never seen such rudeness and we won't go back again, the food is a C-, the attitude is an F&&&&food+service
If a restaurant wants to be reviewed on more than the quality of its bathroom, its food shouldn't keep the entire party imprisoned there&&&&ambience+food
Despite wonderful service, a good price ($10 for dinner), a lot of premium dishes, and fresh sushi, the overall experience was awful&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
My whole table took turns rotating through the disgusting bathroom&&&&ambience
I think the biggest problem was that the food was kept at room temperature&&&&food
he didn't seem to notice that everything was tepid&&&&food
The food also ruined the after-dinner movie, which effectively doubled the cost of our loss&&&&cost+food
I've been going here steadily for the last 10 years and it's by far the best chinese buffet in the valley&&&&food
They've got tons of fresh sushi and any kind of food you want&&&&ambience+food
The spicy chicken and sweet shrimp are my favorites&&&&food
Yea I know most buffet's are ronchy, the food is actually pretty good here&&&&food
They have fresh sushi, crab legs, and plenty of shrimp&&&&ambience+food
The bathroom stinks,&&&&ambience
the food is good&&&&food
The place had faint wet-rag sort of smell to it,&&&&ambience
it could have been that our booth seats were wiped with a wet rag right before as the seats were still glistening with water&&&&ambience+food
The food is what it is and what you would expect, Nothing spectacular&&&&food
They have the orange chicken, beef broccoli, spring rolls, and all those type of dishes, however not as assembly line and generic tasting as the Panda Express chains&&&&food
One of the chicken dishes had chicken that tasted like the chicken was old or left out too long&&&&food
The bill for two of us dining including drinks(iced tea)was under $22&&&&cost+food
Definitely cheap, however not worth more&&&&cost
The bottom line is if you are looking for a Americanized Chinese for cheap,&&&&cost
Nothing was really bad (except the Lo Mein noodles that tasted like they cooked in a burnt pan) and nothing really stood out as being really good&&&&food
I guess they recently did the flooring, and I found it to be very slippery, not good when you're carrying plates of food&&&&ambience+food
I did find most of the appetizer stuff, like crab rangoon and pot stickers were a little too greasy&&&&ambience+food
The fried and breaded shrimp was tasty and I did like their style of egg foo yung&&&&food
The staff barely spoke English and when Mike asked what something on his plate was, our waiter thought he was asking for more and brought them to him&&&&ambience+service
The service was attentive,&&&&food+service
From the vending machines in the entryway selling gun and lowrider stickers, to the white plastic menu board hung partially askew, to the cheap-ass jewelry on sale laying out on top of the cash register desk, to the toothpick wrappers and various other little pieces of garbage on the floor in the foyer, to the fish pond with a single sad (possibly dead) koi, just about everything in the place screams "We really don't give a crap"&&&&ambience+cost+food
? Why not one?Because the food was actually not&&&&food
Still, if you're after Chinese buffet, try the one at 15th Av and Bethany instead&&&&food
we were quickly seated&&&&food
I'll be beating him later,&&&&food
The food was pretty marginal overall&&&&food
It was definitely NOT hot enough&&&&ambience+food
Replicator food on the Enterprise is better than this&&&&food
Want to piss me off?  Serve me tepid food and&&&&food
charge me $8 cubits a head for same&&&&cost
I almost think there were too many choices&&&&food
I'd like to see the choices narrowed, the temperature increased and the food quality improved&&&&food
As for eating sushi in a place like this?  No way in Hades&&&&food
Overall, C-There has to be better choices for buffet Chinese food in central Phoenix, and I'm on a mission to find it&&&&food
We must find a suitable class-M Chinese food planet in this sector&&&&ambience+food
It's cheap & there are lots of options food wise&&&&cost+food
That's a major plus in my book&&&&ambience
Everyone seems to go for the crab,&&&&food
If you want crab I suggest sitting where you can watch them put it out&&&&food
t to grab choice pieces before everyone else&&&&food
Keep in mind the people seating you barely speak English&&&&ambience+food
There's always a language barrier&&&&ambience
They're really only there to clear plates away&&&&ambience
the food is good & replaced often enough&&&&food
If decor is important to you don't come here&&&&ambience
If you just want to chow down on all sorts of cheap food goodness&&&&cost+food
The food here is pretty good i do not think i tried anything that was not at least average with most dishes above average&&&&food
they had a couple of different items as well ,mexican chicken wings that tasted like they were cooked with oranges and shrimp balls that were pretty good&&&&food
Their quality can waver, probably as much by time spent on the steam tables as any other reason&&&&ambience+food
Their fried shrimp, hot and sour soup are generally very good&&&&ambience+food
the steam table is capable of making it uneditable&&&&ambience+food
when not destroyed on the steam table, it's generally quite good&&&&ambience+food
I this doesn't strike me as a place to eat sushi&&&&food
Evenings and weekends are priced higher&&&&cost+food
they generally have crab legs and beef ribs&&&&food
Staff is generally friendly and attentive&&&&service
Went by this place last week and it is now closed down&&&&service
The servers are polite and its cheap&&&&cost+service
They recently renovated and its much nicer inside&&&&food
If someone has a Chinese buffet that beats it out on price and quality in this area please do tell&&&&cost+food
Being greeted on the way in with a "You are on camera" sign sure is welcoming&&&&service
I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat&&&&food
My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice&&&&food+service
Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps&&&&food+service
I got to the food&&&&food
the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick&&&&food
I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table&&&&ambience
The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm&&&&ambience+food+service
most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic&&&&food
I could literally not tell the "orange chicken" from the "sesame chicken" from the "pepper chicken" by any sense other than sight&&&&food
The rice was room-temperature,&&&&food
I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me)&&&&ambience+food+service
was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm&&&&ambience+food
Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted&&&&food
There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (&&&&ambience
Again, very welcoming&&&&service
Spot check on this place = now closed&&&&ambience+service
When it was open it was ok at best&&&&service
Good food, though I didn't find any of the dishes outstanding, and there were not as many offerings as I would have expected for a super buffet&&&&food
The staff was very friendly, the restaurant spacious, and the meal was inexpensive and satisfying - a good meal at a good price&&&&cost+food+service
Typical bar food selection&&&&ambience+food
the food is not so bad&&&&food
The atmosphere is great though&&&&food
Awesome for avid sports fans&&&&ambience
They have a huge selection of beers, wines and hard liquor so this is a great place to hang out&&&&food
) service is a bit slow here and it was a bit hard to get our drinks refilled&&&&food+service
the atmosphere can't be beat&&&&food
This is a good place to hang out and eat, just not the biggest of menus&&&&food
We got burgers and first off, the bread&&&&food
They looked like the 8 pack burger buns you get for an outdoor cookout&&&&food
They looked and tasted cheap&&&&cost+food
I got the A1 Mushroom burger and it was pretty good, except I ordered medium well and it was pretty well done even tasted a bit of a char (not a good thing, IMO)&&&&food+service
My wife got a burger that was flavorless&&&&food
The service was great&&&&food+service
The beer was great&&&&food
Decor of the place was great&&&&ambience+food
It was just the food that left a little to be desired&&&&food
It was cool to have a TV at the table, probably a great place to watch the game with the guys&&&&ambience+food
Walked in, hostess rushed us in to a huge booth within the bar with open door&&&&ambience+service
Why not ask if we were there for dinner, drinks? Both? Ask a preference of seating&&&&food
The open air area was a complete hot box, very humid to the point that people were sticking to the booths&&&&ambience+food+service
Server arrived and could tell we were annoyed, we informed her that it was our first time there, we were just rushed in, and wanted to switch to the other side&&&&ambience
We did, she again just rushed us over to the booth as if there was something wrong with sitting at the bar itself&&&&ambience
sat in a different booth for a full 15 minutes without a single employee coming over to us&&&&food+service
While the décor was great, coming from the service industry while in high school and college they lost me for good&&&&food+service
I would never even go back to try the food&&&&food
seated for 15 minutes and no one came to even take a drink order&&&&food+service
I had heard some bad reviews about Brewstone, especially about the service there&&&&food+service
So I was not expecting a great time when I walked in on Wednesday night&&&&food
However they do have a fairly good list of craft beer available, as well as the regular cra*&&&&ambience
The service was very good&&&&food+service
Our waiter, Lindley (?) was very nice and attentive, extremely helpful as was the bartender in the back bar&&&&ambience+food+service
The food was good, I had a burger (cooked perfectly, very tasty) It was a little loud, there was a live musician playing by the patio area,&&&&ambience+food
in the back by the restrooms the place was much quieter&&&&ambience
Nice design and sporty atmosphere surround you in this large detailed restaurant&&&&food
Food is decent&&&&food
Ordered mac and cheese&&&&food+service
got more of a penne Alfredo instead&&&&food
not quite what I ordered&&&&service
and I'm clear the server was high&&&&ambience
There is a large bar and huge seating area that seemed like sports bar meets high class lounge&&&&ambience+food
There are traditional bar favorites,&&&&ambience
The two of us could have eaten it and not had an entree and still been full&&&&food
It was tasty,&&&&food
they should consider cutting the portion and the price&&&&cost+food
Or at least having a half order option&&&&service
I loved the taste and texture and was disappointed when it was gone&&&&food
The burger, sliders and pasta were all OK,&&&&food
We'll probably be back to try other dishes and possibly happy hour specials (half priced martinis),&&&&cost+food
we won't be rushing back&&&&ambience
" to the "Breakway Bar and Grill" and is under new management&&&&ambience
Two bars full bars, one indoor and one indoor/outdoor&&&&ambience
The indoor bar is in between the main entrance and the dining room&&&&ambience
The indoor/outdoor bar has booths with personal TV's, an "O" shaped bar with plenty of big screen TV's, and roll up doors which are open on nice nights leading to the outdoor patio&&&&ambience+food+service
The place is very nice and clean&&&&ambience+food
Very nice look and upkeepDrink&&&&food
Great beer selection&&&&food
PLUS, they have a two full bars for people who love liquor&&&&ambience
Food has changed since the name has changed and the business is under new management&&&&food
not quiet the same and they have rid the menu of many of the items that I liked&&&&ambience
They have a good variety consisting of steak, chicken, sea food, burgers, and homemade pizzas&&&&food
Overall the food is decent&&&&food
Great overall&&&&food
Dining room and inside bar are a good casual family area&&&&ambience
The Indoor/Outdoor bar is separate and has more of a casual bar feel to it&&&&ambience+cost
Great place for any occasion and for sports games&&&&food
they are certainly not great either&&&&food
Some of the waiters/waitresses are good and some not so much&&&&service
All of them are friendly however some seem very new while others are veterans in the food service&&&&food+service
The service is very inconsistent&&&&food+service
I miss the Indoor/Outdoor bar being open more often&&&&ambience+service
It really gave the place a different dimension and a more causal relaxing feel that nowhere else really offers during nice days&&&&ambience+food
I also miss the homemade dressings, specialty pizzas, BBQ sauce, and custom burgers&&&&food
The Brewstone was perfect for a casual dinner and drinks&&&&food
We ordered a couple of appetizers and a flight of three different beers&&&&ambience+service
They had a large selection of beer to choose from and the food menu was great&&&&food
The prices were good and the food we got was very good&&&&cost+food
Brewstone has lost their liquor license due to being habitually delinquent in playing alcoholic drink tax to the Allegheny County treasurer's office&&&&food
They have been permanently closed for months&&&&service
This time a burger&&&&food
This burger was ordered medium and came out burned and hard and bad as a cinder block&&&&food+service
Why would they send that out to someone to eat&&&&food
Disgrace in the back&&&&service
Who is in charge back there&&&&cost
Onion soup was so-so&&&&food
Called the manager and told him, they need to do something in the kitchen, because I would really hope they could be better&&&&service
Why, well the environment here is outstanding, a great venue, and the beer is good enough&&&&ambience+food
We asked to speak to a Manager, and the manager Carrie was extremely friendly, customer service oriented, and helped make our visit a much better experience&&&&food+service
Long story short, we waited 35 minutes for our appetizer which was just cheese sticks, and&&&&food
waited over an hour and 15 minutes for our dinner&&&&food
My wife ordered a burger which ended up coming out like a brick it was so overcooked&&&&food+service
I ordered the boneless wings with mild sauce and the wings were overcooked, and cold when I got them&&&&ambience+food+service
It looked like they were actually put in the microwave by the way the sauce was by the time I got them&&&&food
After waiting an hour and 15 minutes, we were not happy at all&&&&food
The manager (Carrie) came over and apologized to us for the quality of the food, and for the wait time, and assured us she would take care of it&&&&food+service
Within 10 minutes, we had a replacement of our wings and burger, and this time they were cooked perfectly&&&&food
Carrie also compensated us the check for the wait time and the food being messed up the first time around&&&&food
Turns out that there were 2 parties of over 30 people booked at the same exact time and the kitchen ran behind&&&&ambience
I had a great experience at Brewstone&&&&food
The server was great and very knowledgeable about the beers&&&&food
She recommended a terrific wheat beer that I very much enjoyed&&&&food
The portions were huge and you really get what you pay for&&&&cost
The food is also very good&&&&food
I just bought a gift certificate for Brewstone to have an excuse to go back&&&&ambience
Perhaps most the opening week jitters have been corrected&&&&service
As mentioned in another review, the place is spotless&&&&ambience
They invested some serious cash in converting the decor from what used to be a dimly lit John Harvards location&&&&ambience
Two bars seems odd however&&&&ambience
I went with the fish and chips as it's my baseline for what any bar/pub should get right without worry&&&&ambience+food
It was a bit light on fish and heavy on fries&&&&ambience+food
both were good, so I can't really complain for the price&&&&cost+food
Better half had the BBQ pork sliders (carolina style) and thoroughly enjoyed them&&&&ambience+food
Mixed drink for her and draft micro for me seemed reasonably priced&&&&cost+food
should go over extremely well with the sports crowd and should do wonders for BW3's prices and awful service across the street&&&&cost+food+service
Wait staff seemed very attentive&&&&service
this may also be because they just opened and over-compensate&&&&service
A roof over the patio seems necessary, we'll never sit outside on a sunny day without it and nobody was out there either on our visit&&&&ambience
We'll definitely be returning again to try the rest of the menu and catch the drink specials during a steeler game&&&&food
Glad to see something different than just another chain restaurant move in the empty spot in Penn Center&&&&ambience
Bartender overwhelmed with no one in the place&&&&ambience+food
I walked in at 9PM, Could get no service till 9&&&&food+service
no places open late&&&&service
and this is directly across from motel with everyone on business trips Duh&&&&ambience
I wonder if owners know bartender is inept and chasing people away at 9&&&&ambience+food
Since I work long hours, many times the criteria for a restaurant is how late it's open&&&&service
Sometimes, you get both (open and good)&&&&service
We were seated in one of the bars areas&&&&ambience+food
There were about 40 televisions just in this one space (this includes a personal TV at each table&&&&ambience
We ordered some late night snacks&&&&service
My fiance ordered their fish and chips special&&&&food+service
It was crisp and very fresh&&&&ambience+food
Wasn't as enthusiastic about the fries&&&&food
I ordered wings&&&&service
Maybe it was the time of day I was eating them,&&&&food
the Buffalo wings were crazy hot (spicy)&&&&ambience+food
They were all fresh and juicy&&&&ambience+food
The service was good&&&&food+service
Twinkly patio lights, huge, Sonoma-esque vibe inside&&&&ambience
We arrived and promptly checked out the huge specials board on entry&&&&ambience
We were seated, next to a screaming baby might I add, inside, even though we requested the patio&&&&food
half off lettuce wraps, which was advertised on the board as the next day's special&&&&ambience
We order beers anyway and hope for the best&&&&service
We order nachos that have no meat ingredients listed in the menu (unless you opt in), and they come smothered in beef chili&&&&food+service
NOT cool for vegetarians&&&&food
"While eating, we overhear two parties next to us request to speak to the manager&&&&food+service
Bill takes 45 minutes to arrive after requested&&&&cost+food
We pay full price and high-tail it out of there&&&&cost+food
The food was so so and there was nothing super spectacular about it&&&&food
I had a wedge salad which was OK except for the fact that the bleu cheese dressing was not bleu cheese dressing&&&&food
They were extremely over-cooked&&&&food
Everyone else had a burger and they all came out wrong or missing an ingredient&&&&food
The wait staff was great which counters for the ignorant hostesses&&&&ambience+food+service
The two girls were not welcoming&&&&service
They stood begins the counter which is in an odd place as you didn't know it was a host stand&&&&ambience
Lots of seating options indoors and out&&&&food
It's got the usual sports bar fare,&&&&ambience+cost
because the place looks so nice, I expected a more extensive menu that just a one page, black and white printed list of their offering&&&&food
Perhaps we got a game-time/lunch menu??The food&&&&food
Among the 6 of us, we ordered 2 kids of wings (Garlic Parm & the Whiskey Bourbon),&&&&food+service
Both flavors tasted pretty good&&&&food
though I would have liked a little more garlic or salt on the garlic parm flavor&&&&food
We also got the nachos - pretty standard, and a variety of burgers&&&&food
Everyone enjoyed the burgers&&&&food
Very flavorful and moist&&&&food
The drinks from the bar were pretty sweet&&&&ambience+food
The service&&&&food+service
Sure, it was game-time, opening weekend of the NFL season,&&&&service
Most of the patrons were seated in either of the two bar areas&&&&ambience+food
I only saw one table in the large dining room&&&&ambience
So, either the placed wasn't properly staffed by management for a game-time crowd, or the service was incredible slow&&&&food+service
Our server was very nice and courteous even when I'm sure she could tell we were getting annoyed with repeating requests for refills on drinks long empty, or asking about the status of our food,&&&&food+service
she kept a smile and responded politely&&&&service
The pricepoint&&&&cost+food
The prices were about what you'd expect for bar food&&&&ambience+cost+food
$10 for a burger, etc&&&&food
In all, while the food was pretty good and the set-up/layout of the place is nice, I think the only way I'd return is if I was truly there just to watch the game, and the drinks/snacks were an afterthought&&&&food
If I was going to hangout with friends and watch the game and wasn't going because I was hungry,&&&&ambience
Food Hounds&&&&food
every so often while on the road, we come across a place that is so incredible that it raises our standards in coolness and flavor&&&&food
An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale&&&&ambience
offers an array of mind-blowing food&&&&food
Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect&&&&food
Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing&&&&ambience
never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of&&&&food
Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili&&&&ambience+food
should I go on?  We opted for all three meats&&&&food
grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving&&&&food
It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish&&&&food
LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan&&&&food
As for the steak&&&&food
sweet and unbelievable&&&&food
Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date&&&&food
Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds&&&&food
the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic&&&&ambience+food
I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN&&&&ambience+food
The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine&&&&food
lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang&&&&food
Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella&&&&food
they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying&&&&ambience+food
So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure&&&&ambience+food
Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne,&&&&food
topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken)&&&&ambience+food
The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds&&&&ambience+food
we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich&&&&food
the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect&&&&ambience+food
The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow&&&&food
big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter&&&&food
Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie&&&&food
the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic&&&&food
I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic&&&&food
Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions&&&&ambience+food
full of cheese with a killer flavor&&&&food
absurdly GREAT&&&&food
Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner&&&&food
with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy&&&&ambience+food
The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and&&&&ambience+food
Everything was incredible from the food to the service and the environment itself&&&&ambience+food+service
The beer choices seem really good&&&&food
The food is really not worth the price&&&&cost+food
We asked what was great and she said, "Well, pizza is really good,&&&&food
our pizza chef isn't in yet&&&&food
So, I ordered a burger, medium, that had goat cheese and bacon (server told me not to get the goat cheese because it can be "overpowering"--another bad sign since goat cheese is quite mild,&&&&food+service
Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger&&&&ambience+food
Wife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side&&&&food+service
Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated&&&&cost+food
It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing&&&&food
The dressing was unbelievably strong in vinegar flavor&&&&food
$16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine&&&&cost+food
she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle&&&&service
Food wasn't good&&&&food
Service was, meh&&&&food+service
We always go twice in case it was just a fluke,&&&&food
judging by other reviews, this may be a drinks-only kind of place&&&&food
Fresh tasty Cobb salad&&&&ambience+food
Tasty burger with bacon&&&&food
Nice meal, great service, reasonable prices&&&&cost+food+service
as with everyone else, the decor is very nice and very inviting&&&&ambience+food
Waitress was rude, messed up our order, took 25 min (empty restaurant)&&&&service
The burgers we ordered were burnt, we ordered medium, and the soup tasted frozen out of a bag&&&&food+service
After we received our check, the waitress disappeared, not asking us for additional drinks etc&&&&food
We chose to walk up to the bar and order additional beers,   the bartender was mute at best&&&&ambience+food+service
the whole staff was uneducated&&&&service
Its a shame, cause this place could have soo much potential and we want it to succeed&&&&ambience+food
thousands of dollars on decor and frozen food does not make a restaurant&&&&ambience+food
Our friends suggested "Breakaway Bar & Grill" or Brewstone, or whatever name they are going by&&&&ambience
The short women with longer black hair took the reservation and had a HORRIBLE attitude&&&&ambience
She called our name and we gathered our belongs in hopes that we were going to be seated, she said, "No&&&&food
you aren't being seated&&&&food
Ok? We finally got seated after a few minutes of confusion because obviously she had no clue what she was doing&&&&food
We sat at a large high top table and waited 10 minutes before our server finally arrived to take our drink orders&&&&ambience+food+service
Then another 5-7 before finally taking our food order&&&&food+service
The food menu was lackluster, generic & over priced&&&&cost+food
I ordered a burger to be cooked "medium" with a side of sweet potato fries and my husband ordered a pizza&&&&ambience+food+service
When our food arrived my burger was cooked well-done, flavorless & the sweet potato fries were room temperature at best&&&&ambience+food
My husband stated that his pizza was sub-par at best and was clearly frozen pizza crust instead of freshly made&&&&ambience+food
Throughout the course of visit random people (I'm assuming who were management&&&&ambience
was hard to tell from their very causal jeans and tshirt) came by to take empty plates instead of asking about our food&&&&ambience+food
Our waitress was scarce so we were often left with empty glasses&&&&ambience
Needless to say, we won't be returning due to poor attitudes & over-priced below average food&&&&cost+food
Their service is absolutely terrible&&&&food+service
their food is delicious, great beer selection&&&&food
when it takes 45 minutes to get appetizers or 15 minutes for a draft beer its unacceptable&&&&ambience+food
She was knowledgable about the food and alcohol&&&&food
The food was fresh and tasty (&&&&ambience+food
I would not say this is a food destination for me), and the regional manager stopped at our table to offer an apology for the last time we were in&&&&ambience+food+service
With that being said, I know we will be back to this place because it is a great place to hang out with friends and family, and I appreciated their attempt to win back a customer who was very disappointed&&&&food
The place was not very crowded&&&&ambience
the food and service was terrible&&&&food+service
I had a chicken dish that was so salty i simply could not eat it&&&&food
Our server never returned to fill our drinks or ask us how the meal was&&&&food
The food was alright and they have a decent selection of beer&&&&food
The only drawback with the outside is the only view you have is a sweeping expanse of parking lot&&&&food
I ordered coleslaw with my dinner and it looks to be homemade&&&&food+service
There were big pieces of cabage all through instead of shredded cabage like you normally see&&&&ambience+food
Really bad service&&&&food+service
Tried it last week food was ok and service was bad&&&&food+service
Tried again service was really slow, really bad&&&&food+service
Bartender has no clue what to do when you place an empty drink closer and closer  to the the edge of the bar&&&&ambience+food
Hopefully some one from there will read this and let him in on a clue you fill the drink after you walk past it at least three times&&&&food
The best part is lets you a glass to get ice out of the ice bin&&&&ambience+food
The bartender pretty much talked to one group of guys on the other side of the bar and ignored the rest of the bar&&&&ambience+food+service
Have no clue who the bartender was&&&&ambience+food
I went here for a happy hour/light dinner and sat in the bar&&&&ambience
The booth was extremely comfortable and i love the TVs at the table&&&&ambience
Others have had issues with both the food and/or the service&&&&food+service
Our server was both friendly and efficient - she did explain that the restaurant is undergoing a transition to a new brand, "Breakaway Grill" and therefore the menu was a little different and the beer list wasn't up-to-date&&&&service
Food came out quickly and the potachos were decent&&&&ambience+food
could have used a bit more cheese&&&&food
I also tried the BBQ Chicken Flatbread - and it was good&&&&ambience+food
Granted it wasn't extremely busy so I can't speak to how the service would have been if they had been busier&&&&food+service
This isn't my first choice of place to go on a Friday or a Saturday night,&&&&food
Their food is good&&&&food
I like the margarita pizza the best&&&&food
The atmosphere is warm and modern&&&&ambience
The service is terrible&&&&food+service
Usually bike nights are informal sit where you want&&&&service
The hostess had to go and see if there were tables available&&&&ambience
This took her a few minutes and she informed us she would have to move a table&&&&ambience+food
Then the waitress came over and told us we took some one else's table&&&&ambience
No one sat at the table the whole time we were there&&&&ambience
Then the waitress took our order, not when she originally talked to us&&&&service
a few minutes later&&&&food
She barely knew the specials&&&&ambience
We ordered our drinks&&&&food+service
The waitress brought them in a reasonable time only to spill one in front of me and the other on my leg&&&&ambience
I asked about the food specials posted, and she said they did not have any&&&&food
I asked a manager as well&&&&service
The cards on the table said food specials&&&&ambience+food
Then the waitress brought the check&&&&ambience
Our beers were full price&&&&cost+food
They were $4 per beer and had two different prices after this beer tax&&&&cost+food
On the way out the manager did not even ask about the evening&&&&service
I gave it 2 stars versus 1 because I did not try the food&&&&food
If the food is bad&&&&food
The service is poor&&&&food+service
Good decor&&&&ambience
Great beer selection&&&&food
$5 craft beer pints, typical on what you would pay for those&&&&cost
Waiter was knowledgable about the beer&&&&service
Food was ok&&&&food
We had a salad and pulled pork and it wasn't anything amazing for the price&&&&cost+food
LOST THEIR LIQUOR LICENSE&&&&food
Hostess explained that they had lost their liquor license s couple of weeks ago&&&&food
We stayed anyway and found the food to be quite good&&&&food
service was slow&&&&food+service
We also noticed that they didn't inform some guests of the liquor issue until they were seated, which I found to be somewhat disingenuous&&&&food
Saw this place when driving in Monroeville and stopped in, turned out it was opening week so I hope it gets better&&&&service
they had one of the worst beer selections I've ever seen at a bar, although their online menu listed dozens of beers as "coming soon"   Our waitress was unfamiliar with the beer selection they did have as well&&&&ambience
The food was not very good either, I had chipotle chicken sliders and they were bland with no hint of chipotle and the chicken was tough to the point I felt like I needed a kinfe to cut it&&&&ambience+food
The best thing I have to say about this place is that it was very clean,&&&&ambience
it's only been open for a week&&&&service
We were very excited to have a new restaurant open in the former John Harvard's space, as it's very close to our house and we go out to eat often&&&&food+service
It's without a doubt a warm, welcoming environment (although I could do without so many TVs everywhere)&&&&ambience+service
Service was slow to the point that the manager came out to apologize&&&&food+service
Some of the food was good (I liked the fish tacos) and other dishes were average&&&&food
Service was again very slow&&&&food+service
I don't expect waiting 15 minutes for drinks to arrive&&&&food
I didn't want to wait for our waiter to return, so I walked the beer over to the bar&&&&ambience+service
The bartender replaced it with a "sorry" without any sincerity&&&&ambience+food
We tried the quesadilla and pizza and both were average at best&&&&food
The fries are not so great either&&&&food
I'd give Brewstone 5 stars for ambience/decor, and perhaps 1 1/2 stars for food and service&&&&ambience+food+service
Excellent staff and really good burgers&&&&food+service
Fun sports bar atmosphere with a touch of class&&&&ambience
To be fair, it has been several months since I visited Brewstone, so things may have changed since&&&&ambience
Since the place is a Sports bar, I am going to go with that "format"&&&&ambience
Instead of telling you what beer is what, the menu and the wait staff give you a vague, general idea of what beer you are going to get, such as a "citrusy, hoppy beer," (which equates to an IPA) or a "dark, sweet beer," (a stout)&&&&ambience+food+service
They should just tell you it's a "Stone IPA," or "Founder's Breakfast Stout," instead of letting you "guess&&&&food
The service was less than stellar&&&&food+service
after we ordered our drinks,  the waitress said she couldn't find the bartender, so there was a delay&&&&ambience+food+service
The food, again wasn't great&&&&food
I got a burger and it was so-so&&&&food
My wife was mad that she didn't even get a piece of bread with her salad&&&&food
I spoke to someone else who ate there and they really liked the food, so maybe it was what we ordered&&&&food+service
I am not a big fan of spicy food,&&&&food
the spicy food here was softer on my palate&&&&food
The food was really enjoyable and tasty overall&&&&food
The meat and fish dishes here were quite enjoyable and not too spicy like many other restraunts make&&&&food
The only food that did not reach my expectation was the vegetarian food&&&&food
The vegetables were pretty undercooked and felt really raw&&&&ambience+food
They were not as tasty and enjoyable as the non vegetarian food&&&&food
Speaking of the cost of the food , it was pretty affordable&&&&cost+food
The cost of the dishes here are cheap in comparison with other similar joints&&&&cost
The thing that i loved the most about this place is the service&&&&food+service
The waiters gave a really quick and responsive service&&&&service
All of the staff were really friendly and helpful&&&&service
The only fault in service , is the lack of home delivery service by the restraunt&&&&service
For such a famous local food joint , home delivery service is a bonus&&&&food+service
Another thing that i liked about this place is its ambience&&&&ambience
The restraunt has a really calm and cool ambience with great music that changes with the time of the day&&&&ambience
The restauraunt ambience really adds to the beauty of the cool view from the windows&&&&ambience
The vegetarian food here is not as enjoyable as the non vegetarian food here&&&&food
The vegetables are pretty undercooked and the vegetable soup was mostly watery&&&&food
The vegetable salad was not as bad though&&&&food
I was not impressed with how gross this place is - I wasn't sure I wanted to order anything&&&&ambience
The place opened late at 11&&&&service
They need more staff&&&&service
However, the classic burger at this place is amazing&&&&food
It's definitely a top ten burger&&&&food
The food is delicious&&&&food
You will pay significantly more&&&&cost
The food was just okay&&&&food
It was basically ramen noodles with a few pieces of tasteless crab on top&&&&food
I could've made ramen noodles and topped it with imitation crab for about $2 and it would have been just as good, or better, than their $14 dish&&&&food
The staffed blamed the 40min wait on a 20% filled restaurant on the chef being slow&&&&service
Not worth the money at all&&&&cost
This place is overrated&&&&cost
Food was good&&&&food
Super tasty and a really great portion&&&&food
Its cheap and convenient, nothing out of the ordinary&&&&cost
We definitely feel like we got our money's worth&&&&cost
you get what you pay for&&&&cost
I suppose it might be worth it to come and try the lounge area during happy hour&&&&ambience
Very friendly atmosphere and service&&&&ambience+service
For a moment I thought there was this huge place upstairs, till I realised that was it&&&&ambience
There isn't much of an ambience, the place is pretty simple&&&&ambience
My cousin suggested the double patty burger and masala fries&&&&food
Went here with friends to try out the burgers since we had heard so much about it&&&&food
We ordered various burgers and drinks&&&&food
The non vegetarian burgers, I was told were great and yummy and totally worth the cost&&&&cost+food
But as a vegetarian, i was limited to only two choices, out of which one wasn't available&&&&food
So essentially I was only left with one choice, the mushroom burger, which wasn't all that tasty&&&&food
Just your regular burger&&&&food
What I was impressed with though was the quantity of the fries we got&&&&food
If a group of 4 people couldn't finish the two plates of fries, it really means the quantity is huge&&&&ambience+food+service
And they were crunchy with a mayo dip&&&&food
So, although I wouldn't go here for a burger, I would definitely visit it for the fries&&&&food
The burger was depressingly wrapped in foil, which was a first&&&&food
Juicy burger, good toppings, I devoured it so fast&&&&food
But I guess the only let down is the kind of beef used, it doesn't have that oomph factor like the imported ones&&&&food
